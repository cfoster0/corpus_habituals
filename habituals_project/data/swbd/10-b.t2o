865:38	###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###Good-bye Sharon . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Good * talking to you Archie .

E_S ###And \[ the first kind of invasion of , \+ the first type of privacy \] seemed *T*-2 invaded *-1 to me , and very much everyday in this country , E_S 
868:106	###SpeakerB86 . ###Good * talking to you Archie . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Well , the first thing for me is \[ I wonder , \+ I see \] a couple of different ways of * talking about what privacy is *T*-1 , ###um , if \[ privacy is something that *T*-2 disturbs your private state , \+ I mean an invasion of privacy is something that *T*-3 disturbs your private state , \] E_S that 's one thing , E_S ###and if privacy is something that *T*-1 comes into your private state and extracts information from it , in other words , finds something *ICH*-2 out about you that 's another . E_S ###And \[ the first kind of invasion of , \+ the first type of privacy \] seemed *T*-2 invaded *-1 to me , and very much everyday in this country , E_S ###but in the second time , at least overtly , uh , where someone comes in and , uh , finds out information about you that *T*-1 should be private *T*-2 , uh , does not seem , uh , um , obviously , everyday . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 I agree with that . E_S 
937:99	###and , I mean , you know , the classic , oh , I do n't know C I A conspiracy theories or whatever , would have such parties *-1 trying *-2 to do it without your knowledge . E_S ###So there 's , , things that *T*-1 invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them *T*-2 and possibly things that *T*-3 invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it , E_S ###and I ca n't talk about the second one other than * \[ \[ to , \+ to , \] \+ to \] generate paranoia . E_S ###It 's a surmise E_S ###and , I 'd like *-1 to think that it 's quite low , at least in this country . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###* \[ To , \+ to \] surmise . It is there .

E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Well , I guess , 0 although , \[ I , \+ \] well , that 's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is *T*-1 *T*-3 *T*-2 , because , uh , if that 's the case of a tree falling in the forest E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###and I 'm not feeling invaded 
962:10	###but I do n't feel invaded by it . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###I do n't , have a sense of threat *ICH*-1 in general from those sorts of things , E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###I 'm not sure why . E_S ###Uh , I guess 0 it comes from a sense of fact or facts E_S 
1021:79	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###SpeakerA59 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Right . E_S ###Exactly . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Yeah . E_S ###And , um , one of the problems with the Lotus data base was , um , that it was uncontrolled access to who *T*-1 would have that information . E_S 
1033:68	###SpeakerB62 . ###Right . E_S ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###\[ It would , \+ it would \] be pirated *-1 E_S ###and they would n't bother *-1 to check that carefully anyway to someone who *T*-2 's offering , you know , full cash price , for it . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###I mean , you know , you ca n't tell it , what a company really has *-1 to do *T*-2 with it E_S 
1038:56	###and they would n't bother *-1 to check that carefully anyway to someone who *T*-2 's offering , you know , full cash price , for it . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###I mean , you know , you ca n't tell it , what a company really has *-1 to do *T*-2 with it E_S ###and there 's something rather ominous about * having virtually anyone , any hacker being able *-1 to know what your income is *T*-2 , what your spending habits are *T*-3 , E_S ###\[ \[ and , \+ you know , and , \] \+ and \] that hacker just has *-1 to get \[ in to , \+ in touch \] with the sneak thief E_S ###and suddenly \[ and then \+ \] what *T*-1 started as an invasion of privacy can be an invasion of your actual home . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
1042:48	###I mean , you know , you ca n't tell it , what a company really has *-1 to do *T*-2 with it E_S ###and there 's something rather ominous about * having virtually anyone , any hacker being able *-1 to know what your income is *T*-2 , what your spending habits are *T*-3 , E_S ###\[ \[ and , \+ you know , and , \] \+ and \] that hacker just has *-1 to get \[ in to , \+ in touch \] with the sneak thief E_S ###and suddenly \[ and then \+ \] what *T*-1 started as an invasion of privacy can be an invasion of your actual home . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###And I guess 0 that turns out *-1 to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you 're feeling , threatened as a result \[ of , \+ of \] it E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . 
1059:36	###I also thought about it , \[ was of , \+ \] uh , *-1 waiting *-2 to talk to you that , another thing that *T*-4 occurred to me is 0 there is not so much invasion of my privacy because I know how *-5 to behave *T*-6 such that there is n't *?* . E_S ###But I realized 0 I have *-1 to behave in a certain way in order *-2 to not have people invade my privacy . E_S ###If I deviate from social norms of behavior , if I run up and down the street *-1 yelling or something , someone 's going *-2 to invade my privacy very quickly . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###And I realize \[ that \+ that , \] I mean , I can take that for granted E_S ###but \[ I used *-1 to , \+ I used *-2 to \] live in India E_S ###and things are quite different *ICH*-1 there in terms of that . E_S ###There 's less of a sense of privacy . E_S 
1095:20	###SpeakerA83 . ###You know , it very much is *?* . E_S ###But on the other hand , I realized 0 I could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic , E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###and people would leave , me alone . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . 
1117:68	###\[ and , \+ and \] that it *EXP*-2 's fascinating * \[ to , \+ to \] think a lot of someone who *T*-1 does n't know how *-3 to say private *T*-4 . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###And that 's really , um , N_S ###well , I mean , \[ I , \+ I \] wonder how people have sex *T*-1 , and things like that , E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###SpeakerA93 . ###I mean , \[ they a- , \+ \] , N_S ###you go to India E_S 
1144:8	###\[ Are th- , \+ are there \] any other specific things \[ \[ that , \+ that \] you feel like , \+ \[ where , \+ where \] you feel \] your privacy to be invaded *-1 on a day-to-day basis or either on a growing frequency *T*-2 ? E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###All \[ the class- , \+ the other classic \] examples , the Jehovah 's Witness \[ or , \+ or \] Mormons or someone knocking at the front door , um , which *T*-1 is more intrusive because I have *-2 to really tell someone *-3 to go away . E_S ###And there 's that sense of , I have now opened my door ###they now see what I look like *T*-1 , what I live like *T*-2 E_S ###\[ and nor- , \+ and they 're \] doing something that normally I really only invite , people to *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###Because I , \[ \[ \[ any , \+ anyone , \] \+ any friend , \] \+ anyone \] 0 I give my number to *T*-1 is welcome *-2 to call me , E_S 
1162:53	###and normally when they call *T*-1 , you 're either in the shower , E_S ###or you 're in the middle of * cooking something E_S ###and you have *-1 to stop everything *-2 to run to the phone . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Yes , E_S ###yes . E_S ###\[ Is , \+ is \] that one that you 're talking about *T*-1 . N_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###That was the big one 0 I 'm talking about *T*-1 . E_S ###I work weird hours , E_S 
1261:35	###\[ And , \+ and \] I do n't like the way that they do it either *T*-1 , E_S ###\[ and , \+ and , \] it *EXP*-1 's their mission that they do it . E_S ###They go door to door E_S ###and they go out into the public E_S ###and they actually have the , uh , teenagers serving two years \[ like \+ you would say like \] in an army and two years in * going around and doing missionary type work E_S ###and , uh , I do n't know , E_S ###I just , um , do n't particularly care for that at all . E_S ###And \[ that , \+ that 's \] one thing that I feel really strongly about *T*-1 though , is , uh , you know , people *ICH*-2 coming up to my door , and especially religious organizations and wanting *-3 \[ to \+ uh , you know , to \] try and get me to join or , you know , become interested in their religion , E_S ###because I have my own . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . 
1586:21	###SpeakerA88 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###I think 0 it 's great , E_S ###I really , N_S ###SpeakerB89 . ###Yeah , E_S ###SpeakerA90 . ###and I look for more of that in the next generation . E_S ###SpeakerB91 . ###I do too , especially as women get up in management \[ and , \+ and \] can be in on those decision making , N_S 
1823:100	###well , \[ ma- , \+ maybe \] it was n't that one . E_S ###Because , \[ it was a living , \+ it was a living \] person that \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] thinking of *T*-1 \[ that , \+ um , that *T*-2 \] said , `` You know , hey that , those are my words . '' E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###And , uh , I guess that \[ they , \+ \[ ###because \+ \] they \] had n't originally gotten , um , permission *ICH*-2 , from him *-1 to use it . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . 
1967:11	###SpeakerB104 . ###Well , you know , really that 's not world music . E_S ###But , \[ what , \+ what \] Paul Simon 's doing *T*-1 , I think 0 *T*-5 \[ \[ is , \+ is , \] \+ is \] great because he 's , you know \[ \[ I think , \+ I think \] that \+ \] using , I guess 0 what they call *T*-2 it is *RNR*-3 eclectic , you know . *-4 drawing from a lot of different sources and making , you know , a synthesis of a new type of music . ###Um , E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###SpeakerA107 . ###What do you mean *T*-1 by world music ? E_S ###SpeakerB108 . 
1995:6	###SpeakerB116 . ###Because , I mean , there are some ###, I mean , N_S \[ I , \+ I \] li- , N_S ###there are some , you know , types of heavy metal that I really like *T*-1 , E_S ###\[ but , \+ but \] \[ I would n't , \+ I would n't \] say that \[ I , \+ I \] completely like heavy metal .

2444:11	###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , um , E_S ###I do n't know about you E_S ###but where I am *T*-1 we have \[ a \+ like an \] extremely lax dress policy at work E_S ###and it varies like every day .

2909:76	###SpeakerA49 . ###Yes , E_S ###yes E_S ###it is *?* . E_S ###Down in the more southern and western areas . E_S ###And , of course we are , um , about two hours from the northern border , straight south , E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , very windy . E_S 
3268:33	###SpeakerA39 . ###But , see , for example , they have , see what , N_S ###but other bands consider it like really hard rock . E_S ###It 's like brash metal , which all 0 they do *T*-1 is 0 like , they have this guitar and they just bang at the guitar *T*-2 , E_S ###and the guitar is set *-1 like , really low , E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Yeah . E_S ###No , E_S ###I do n't really care for that too much , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . 
3296:44	###No , E_S ###I do n't like that music . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###But , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] what they do *T*-1 . E_S ###\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] what some people call like *T*-1 really heavy metal . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . 
3303:13	###SpeakerB52 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###And , see , the difference , I guess , between hard rock and heavy metal is \[ that \+ \] the lyrics also . E_S ###Like really , like heavy metal , \[ wo- , \+ is \] considered *-1 , ###like the words heavy metal E_S ###and , like , you always thought about , like , suicide . And * killing people and stuff like that . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . 
3383:8	###\[ I like , \+ I like \] the old Rolling Stones . E_S ###I do n't like the new stuff . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Of the Stones ? E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I agree . E_S ###That 's the ne- , N_S 
3452:32	###SpeakerA101 . ###And , they both loved the movie , right ? E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###They said 0 the music 's great , E_S ###it took me back to the sixties , and stuff like that . E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA105 . 
3456:28	###SpeakerA103 . ###They said 0 the music 's great , E_S ###it took me back to the sixties , and stuff like that . E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###And then , one of them said , well , everything is great , E_S ###but I 'm going *-1 to give it thumbs down . E_S ###And they go , E_S ###but why ? E_S 
3461:43	###SpeakerA105 . ###And then , one of them said , well , everything is great , E_S ###but I 'm going *-1 to give it thumbs down . E_S ###And they go , E_S ###but why ? E_S ###Because \[ it 's \+ like , the end is , \] like , really depressing . E_S ###And so , N_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA107 . 
3667:60	###SpeakerA5 . ###Have you all been able *-1 to do much \[ as , \+ uh , as \] a full family these days , all of you .

3681:44	###SpeakerB10 . ###No , E_S ###I do n't . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I do n't either , E_S ###it makes it a little bit easier , I think , that way . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it does , E_S 
3724:15	###Yeah , E_S ###right E_S ###and , uh , you know , \[ \[ they , \+ we , \] \+ you know , we \] go to the park E_S ###or we go in the backyard and sit down E_S ###an , N_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###\[ That 's wha- , \+ yeah , that 's what \] we mostly do *T*-1 , pretty simple things . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . 
3782:32	###SpeakerA45 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###we , N_S ###I guess 0 there 's Science Place One and Science Place Two . E_S ###We 've only been in , I think 0 it 's *RNR*-1 Science Place Two . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###\[ I , is , \+ I 'm \] not sure which one we went into *T*-1 , E_S ###it was about a year or so ago , when we went *T*-1 .

3835:37	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###and it 's a indoor fun park E_S ###and it has a bunch of different rides for kids . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###That 's sounds fun too . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###And parents get in *-1 free E_S ###and it 's like , during the week , E_S it 's like five dollars admission per child , all day . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . 
3845:15	###\[ And , \+ and \] you said 0 about Plano and Campbell is *T*-1 the petting , E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###The petting farm , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###That sounds fun E_S ###I think 0 maybe we 'll try *-1 to do that . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah E_S

3945:88	###SpeakerA14 . ###Vociferously . E_S ###SpeakerB15 . ###Okay , E_S ###well that 's the reason why I like both of those programs *T*-1 is because they 're kind of based on books . E_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###And , the plots are more , um , challenging , you know , than the sitcoms of regular T V . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . 
4034:14	###and he still comes off *-1 great . E_S ###SpeakerA52 . ###Well , you know \[ he was , \+ when was it *T*-1 , last year or year before last , he was \] voted *-2 the sexiest actor in movies , or something .

4298:23	###But , it 's not \[ a , \+ a \] structured sort of thing , E_S ###and I have *-1 to admit 0 I have a certain resistance to the idea of exercising for exercising 's sake , E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###and perhaps , it 's because somehow that implies to me 0 it 's not fun , or something like that . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well \[ I , \+ I 've , \] N_S ###my , N_S 
4449:12	###Uh , E_S there 's an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness , \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ \] at least in urban California . E_S ###And , maybe not , N_S ###I do n't know about rural California too well . E_S ###But , in urban California it 's just , you know , N_S ###for all 0 I know *T*-1 aerobics started out here . E_S ###I do n't know where they actually started *T*-1 , E_S ###but \[ they , \+ \] you know , the craze really picked up big here E_S ###and before that there was the running craze .

Some sort of relaxation E_S ###SpeakerB118 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA119 . ###and , they seem pretty , you know , N_S ###they do n't have the hard body . E_S ###They do n't have that perfect look , E_S 
4715:17	###SpeakerB8 . ###Well , you live almost in Oklahoma . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Not too far . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Yeah . E_S ###That 's kind of ironic , because I do n't live too far from Oklahoma either . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Huh-uh . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . 
4750:4	###and they were intending *-1 to kill people , E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Huh-uh . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###I mean , that was their job , as they killed in Washington D C . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Oh , I know , E_S ###I know . E_S ###I know . E_S ###Um , I think 0 nowadays people \[ just , \+ really just , \] 
4854:4	###SpeakerB64 . ###But , you know , * putting them in prison , my God , that does n't work .

4898:20	###SpeakerA79 . ###Huh-uh . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###SpeakerA81 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###Because , you know , we are what we teach *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###Huh-uh . E_S ###SpeakerB84 .

5864:14	###Yeah . E_S ###It 's like , N_S ###no E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] mean , I B M is like , N_S ###there 's a joke about I B M which *T*-1 says , you know , it 's like , uh , N_S ###\[ all , \+ all \] the major companies get into \[ a , \+ a \] boating race , ###right ? E_S ###SpeakerB124 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA125 . 
5887:53	###he goes , uh , the problem was that there were five people saying * row , row , row and one person rowing , ###right .

5928:35	###MUMBLEx * push paper around . E_S ###SpeakerA145 . ###SpeakerB146 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###They go what 's that *T*-1 ? ###This track which *T*-2 it 's going around the world E_S 
5938:35	###And then this guy from \[ Federal , \+ Federal \] Express comes along .

E_S ###SpeakerB150 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA151 . ###And so it 's like the same thing with I B M . You know , E_S ###so they have this think tank . E_S ###And they got *-1 to come up with ideas . E_S 
5938:51	###And then this guy from \[ Federal , \+ Federal \] Express comes along . E_S ###They go what 's that *T*-1 ? ###This track which *T*-2 it 's going around the world E_S ###and they can tell you where your package is *T*-1 anywhere , any time .

E_S 
5956:11	###And a lot of times you figure , you know , with the support that they provide *T*-1 , you know , N_S ###people generally go with that because they figure that \[ the , \+ \] you know , you probably wo n't get fired *-1 for *-2 getting I B M material . E_S ###Whereas if you try something different , \[ they 'll \+ they 'll \] say yeah , E_S ###SpeakerA155 . ###And it fails E_S ###and you 're dead . E_S ###SpeakerB156 . ###\[ why did n't you buy , \+ why did n't you try \] something more mainline *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA157 . ###Yeah . E_S 
5985:19	###SpeakerB166 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA167 . ###But they wo n't let you off . E_S ###What they 'll do *T*-1 is like N_S ###* suppose , you know , like 0 you 're a manager . E_S ###So they 'll put you into *-1 keeping up the paper , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB168 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA169 . 
6010:6	###But \[ it does- , \+ they do n't \] really say that , you know , E_S ###\[ you 're , \+ you 're \] always going *-1 to have great career conditions . E_S ###SpeakerA177 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB178 . ###\[ He- , \+ hey , \] that 's kind of sad . E_S ###SpeakerA179 . ###No , E_S ###but I mean , \[ it 's like , \+ it 's like \] \[ they , \+ they \] have just like different policy . E_S ###I do n't know . E_S 
6067:8	###SpeakerA197 . ###SpeakerB198 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA199 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB200 . ###SpeakerA201 . ###MUMBLEx for example , you test a chip . E_S ###It ca n't last seven years E_S ###but it can last five . E_S 
6079:42	###SpeakerB202 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA203 . ###And so that 's , N_S ###I mean , they 're still around I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB204 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ I 've seen , \+ well I 've seen \] them around anyway . You know MUMBLEx . E_S ###SpeakerA205 . ###So , that 's what they do *T*-1 . E_S 
6211:25	###SpeakerA7 . ###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###And I started *-1 thinking that over the years that importance has changed E_S ###and I suspect that that 's probably true for everyone . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###When I was much younger *T*-1 it *EXP*-2 was , uh , less important * to consider retirement and less important * to consider medical benefits . E_S 
6212:8	###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###And I started *-1 thinking that over the years that importance has changed E_S ###and I suspect that that 's probably true for everyone . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###When I was much younger *T*-1 it *EXP*-2 was , uh , less important * to consider retirement and less important * to consider medical benefits . E_S ###But as I grow older and my family grows , \[ it , \+ the medical benefits \] are more important E_S 
6437:6	###SpeakerB82 . ###That sounds really good . E_S ###I read a thing , E_S ###I do n't even remember if it was in the DALLASITE *RNR*-1 or the INSITE *RNR*-1 one , about uh , companies allowing you , N_S ###and they said that T I was looking into it , * to purchase extra vacation days .

E_S ###You know , if you 've been there , you know , under five years \[ and \+ \] you get two weeks of vacation E_S but that 's really not enough E_S and you want an extra week , then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by *-2 saying , okay , I 'm going *-1 to want an extra five days this year E_S ###and they 'll take a set amount out of each paycheck , you know , E_S ###and they 're deducting it all along , E_S ###so \[ you , \+ you \] can have an extra five days off and be paid *-1 for them at the time , you know , E_S ###you 're really not being paid *-1 for them , E_S 
6480:55	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###SpeakerB100 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###But it should be a standard \[ and , \+ and \] not left *-1 up to either the whim or the current overhead rate \[ t- , \+ uh , that *T*-2 's \] running in each department . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Well , E_S ###and , yeah , E_S 
6551:45	###SpeakerA17 . ###Huh-uh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###\[ and , \+ but , \] I do n't know . E_S ###If you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then maybe countries that *T*-1 are so poor that they would n't be able *-2 to really , you know , send children to do that . N_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###I did n't know . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . 
6805:6	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA113 . ###Who *T*-1 's going *-2 to run it , you know , E_S ###what , E_S ###how , E_S ###oh , it 's just so many N_S ###SpeakerB114 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###\[ Like , \+ like \] I said at the beginning I 've got so many connections with people in Central America . E_S 
6883:8	###SpeakerA141 . ###but any rate that 's off the subject , E_S ###SpeakerB142 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA143 . ###But , I , N_S ###SpeakerB144 . ###\[ They , \+ they \] do n't get paid *-1 for it , E_S ###\[ and , \+ um , but \] there is funding that *T*-1 comes , E_S ###they 're supposedly saving up on their own E_S

7033:6	###SpeakerB53 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA54 . ###Because \[ they , \+ they \] figure that , ###that 's correct . E_S ###SpeakerB55 . ###You 're defeating the purpose . E_S ###SpeakerA56 . ###SpeakerB57 . ###SpeakerA58 .

7498:50	###yeah , E_S ###that 's , uh , N_S ###\[ and then , \+ and then \] people always get upset about it , too , because , you know , every year \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] politicians are the ones that *T*-1 are usually pushing for more people to vote , E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###Uh-huh .

7588:22	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB51 . ###MUMBLEx * hope some of the local , N_S ###well that 's what \[ they , \+ they \] keep *-3 saying *T*-1 that it seems like people with old-fashioned values are the ones that *T*-2 are n't turning out \[ at the , \+ at the \] booths , E_S ###\[ they , \+ they \] say that these older voters that , uh , you know , \[ they , \+ they \] feel like the kids are running \[ the , \+ the \] country E_S ###so \[ they , \+ they \] do n't come out , turn out *-1 to vote E_S ###and they 're the ones that , uh , you know , *T*-1 really know what *T*-2 's going on , have the experience and seen , you know , how politicians can , you know , screwup *T*-3 or what ever .

E_S ###SpeakerB55 . ###SpeakerA56 . 
7682:8	###They called me at , uh , ten o'clock one night , E_S ###that was very strange . E_S ###SpeakerA84 . ###Yeah .

E_S 
8351:19	###and they 're good for about five years or four years E_S ###and after that they start *-1 falling apart .

8425:6	###\[ N- , \+ no , \] E_S ###we 're , N_S ###well , uh , our kids are kind of still small now , E_S ###and we had thought before maybe a lot older 0 we do n't need such a large house that we 'll sell it , E_S ###but he will not build a second one himself .

8507:22	###Okay , E_S ###bye-bye . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Bye . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Well , the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that I , um , N_S ###since I 'm in school I do n't , like , basically have a monthly budget because I 'm living off my dad , E_S ###but the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that , um , I have *-1 to keep it under control because , for example , you know , it 's like \[ the , \+ the \] beginning of the semester when you go *-2 to pay for everything *T*-3 , everything is pretty rough , E_S ###but he controls that part E_S ###but , then whenever , you know , N_S 
8518:63	###And the only thing that \[ I , \+ I \] basically spend my money on *T*-1 is just food E_S ###\[ and , \+ um , so , \] N_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###What about tuition and rent ?

8522:11	###Who *T*-1 takes care of that ? E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Well , the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that I live in a dorm . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###So , uh , what *T*-1 happens is 0 you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . 
8547:10	###SpeakerB12 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Because , um , they do n't allow me to work since , uh , I 'm a foreign student . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###And so \[ they , \+ the government \] does n't allow me to work . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah , E_S 
8602:11	###so you call him collect ? E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###No . E_S ###Because it is more expensive that way . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###What *T*-1 makes you , think so ? E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###\[ Any , \+ any , \] um , N_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###SpeakerA39 .

E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . 
8726:50	###Well then , uh , see , uh , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] one of the points which I do n't see *T*-1 , E_S ###like \[ I , \+ I \] do n't give a lot of gifts during Christmas E_S ###and \[ \[ I , \+ you know , I \] do n't wa- , \+ I do n't like \] *-1 to give any at all E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerA87 . 
8757:15	###That 's great . Utilitarian . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###SpeakerB96 . ###SpeakerA97 . ###Right , E_S ###but N_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###Necessary things , no frivolous gifts . E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###right , E_S 
8875:8	###There 's something about * working with wood \[ that , \+ that \] I enjoy *T*-1 , that , N_S ###I do n't know if it 's the saw dust or the mess 0 you make *T*-1 or the smell of the wood E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###As you know , I think 0 it 's more like the mess 0 you make *T*-1 , is n't it *?* ?

9024:13	###I planted , uh , zucchini last year . E_S ###Uh , I planted four hills of them . E_S ###I think 0 I had three or four seeds in each one of them , E_S ###and those things just flat took over .

9249:11	###SpeakerB58 . ###Uh , I probably would n't mind if it really came down to it . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Well it 's just the same thing with \[ the car , \+ uh , uh , the gasoline , \] E_S ###now is a wonderful time 0 * to smack a fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline *T*-1 , so that we do n't , uh , run into the kind of problems 0 we recently had *T*-2 E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Oh yes , E_S ###yes , E_S ###yes .

E_S ###I mean , while it *EXP*-1 's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories , uh , pollute a lot , uh , if you look at how much pollution *T*-2 is say kicked *-3 up by an active volcano , uh , it *EXP*-4 's certainly less than clear that anything 0 man can do *T*-5 in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all . E_S ###What do you think *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Um , well , you talked about , uh , volcanos . E_S ###I 'm not sure how many active volcanos there are *T*-1 now , \[ and , \+ and \] what the amount of material that they do , uh , put *T*-2 into the atmosphere . E_S 
11826:6	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###It 's mainly farms and , uh , no heavy industry . E_S ###Attleboro , itself , N_S ###I live in Rhode Island . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Oh , I see . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###And , it 's in the north , E_S ###I live up in the , uh , northeast corner E_S

11855:41	###SpeakerB18 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###You mean like from the coal . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###we generate , N_S 
11863:21	###yeah , E_S ###we generate , N_S ###one of \[ our , \+ our \] biggest electrical plants in Rhode Island uses coal *-1 to , uh , generate electricity .

E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah , E_S 
12042:35	###SpeakerA89 . ###So , you would , N_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###But diesel engines . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###Yeah , E_S ###diesel engines . E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###\[ \[ It , \+ you know , it 's , \] \+ it , \] N_S ###I mean , they do generate a lot of soot E_S

12207:18	###what do you like \[ to , \+ *-1 to \] cook *T*-2 ?

12294:16	###it was so fattening . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###That sounds good . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###But , I do n't think 0 we gained any weight from it E_S ###so .

E_S ###When I 'm entertaining *T*-1 , I do n't take that thing into consideration unless it 's really , really , N_S ###like a lot of women will turn down dessert if it 's too rich simply because they do n't want the extra calories , E_S 
12318:9	###So , um , I 've read a good brownie recipe . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Oh , that 's good .

13465:15	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###SpeakerA65 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###So I try *-1 to , N_S ###I actually during that period of time \[ from , \+ you know , usually from \] six o'clock or six thirty , whenever I get home *T*-1 , until eight or so , I will shut off the phone E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Uh-huh .

13500:13	###but \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] where answering machines are nice *T*-1 , because if it 's really important they 'll leave a message E_S ###and I can call them back . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###But , uh , at work I have so many phone calls from customers calling in , E_S ###sometimes \[ it is just , \+ I just want \] *-1 to get away from the phone ringing because \[ it , \+ it \] really does annoy me .

13644:54	###Well , I guess 0 I would first identify myself as middle aged E_S ###and therefore , *-1 having seen the last generation , I guess 0 it \[ puts me in , \+ you know , gives me \] a perspective on that . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh , I , am quite positive on the things *ICH*-2 that I have seen *T*-1 happen recently relative to women \[ in , \+ both in \] society and in the work place , E_S ###uh , there 's no doubt about the fact that when I was first graduated *-1 from college *T*-2 the impression was that a woman 's career would consist of a childbearing years and perhaps *ICH*-3 a return to the office , but not necessarily . E_S 
13679:29	###SpeakerA15 . ###So , \[ \[ I , \+ I do n't , \] \+ \[ I , \+ I \] guess \] 0 we 'll have *-1 to see another generation *-2 to see what differences a child being brought *T*-3 up , you know , in \[ a , \+ uh , kind of a , \] uh , community , rather than a home .

13737:43	###SpeakerA43 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 I have a philosophical problem with that .

13749:32	###SpeakerA47 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Uh , I do n't have boys , E_S ###that \[ does n't , \+ did n't \] bother me , E_S ###* never has *?* .

E_S ###SpeakerB50 . 
14073:19	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###SpeakerA13 . ###Yeah , E_S ###but I think 0 there 's enough news *ICH*-1 out there that they could pass on more factual information to us , E_S ###and like you said , * save the commentaries because I 'm going *-1 to listen to \[ the , \+ the \] news and draw my own opinions .

14164:92	###Uh , \[ i- , \+ I \] spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst , E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Really ?

14283:50	###Well , they did have a fairly decent year finally this year . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###At least they 're coming around . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Yeah , E_S ###they 're going *-1 to get better . E_S ###I mean , you know . N_S ###SpeakerB10 .

19215:6	###SpeakerB130 . ###Huh .

19265:14	###\[ It 's , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] hard * \[ to , \+ to \] know anymore if it 's \[ a , \+ a \] threat one way or another because , uh , it used *-3 to be \[ s- , \+ \] so , \[ f- , \+ \] much in the past that whatever the top said *T*-2 the rest fell , you know , rank and file in behind it .

21246:19	###and they kind of are in different spectrums , I think 0 *T*-1 . Um , E_S ###one of them is QUANTUM LEAP E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Okay .

21413:22	###SpeakerA65 . ###Well , I 'm afraid 0 that 's what \[ they , \+ they \] really wanted *-1 to do *T*-2 , um , E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 most shows were doing that , E_S ###and then they went away from it E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###and now they 're starting *-1 to go back to it , E_S 
21446:126	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###And so I guess 0 that 's what they decide *-1 to do *T*-2 E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###* Just go ahead and quit the wondering E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###\[ and , \+ and , \] N_S ###SpeakerA79 . 
21535:56	###well , \[ I \+ I \] hardly ever watch it , E_S ###SpeakerB112 . ###Usually Tuesday nights I 'm out , E_S ###so .

E_S ###SpeakerA115 . 
21758:10	###SpeakerB43 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA44 . ###it 's not really just to * getting *-1 to sight see . E_S ###SpeakerB45 . ###Right . E_S ###Well , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a beautiful city . E_S ###SpeakerA46 . ###Oh , I bet 0 it is *?* , too . E_S ###SpeakerB47 . 
21901:6	###we have *-1 to take them , and , you know * to do it . E_S ###SpeakerB91 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA92 . ###And that really gets kind of aggravating after a while E_S ###because you 're saying , Well , I work full time too , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB93 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###but , uh , \[ it 's just , \+ it 's just \] something that , you know , N_S 
22009:11	###SpeakerB125 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] now I 'm looking for a job before they have *-1 to send me back home E_S ###SpeakerA126 . ###Uh-huh .

22106:62	###and then there 's a very large Hispanic population there . E_S ###And the one thing that we noticed *T*-1 that *T*-2 over the years has gotten worse and worse is Hispanic , uh , gang crime in the city E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Oh , E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###and that has , uh , been the worse thing that we 've seen *T*-1 happening .

E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Um , the majority of the actual gang crimes , like \[ the pat- , \+ the drive by shootings \] and stuff stays in the neighborhoods , E_S 
22128:36	###very much so , E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###SpeakerB14 . ###very much so , E_S ###in fact , for a while there they had downtown if you were *-1 to come to a stop light , they had a rash of \[ where people were , \+ when people were \] stopped at stop signs *T*-2 that people would get in their car and hold a knife and hold them up . E_S ###So now , ever since then , when you drive into the city *T*-1 , most people keep their doors locked while they 're in the car , until they get down there , E_S ###and once you 've reached \[ the , \+ the \] river walk area , which *T*-1 is the tourist area , it 's usually pretty safe during the day , if you 're just kind of cautious and do n't go down the back streets or alleys , \[ and , \+ \] um , you know , or alone . E_S ###If you stay with the groups and along the area where they have the river patrol cops *T*-1 , it 's very nice .

E_S 
22164:35	###And they said , no , E_S ###it 's very safe in the daytime E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###but at night , they even have the policemen come around at dusk and sound their sirens , * pretty much telling people , * be wary , you know , and get off the beach . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###It 's just so sad , you know , E_S ###it is just really so sad , you know , E_S ###it is just really so sad because you ca n't enjoy anything any more . E_S

E_S ###Um , in San Antonio I do n't know what the answer is *T*-1 . E_S ###Education , I think 0 *T*-1 , is a lot of it . E_S ###Um , so many of the kids are drop outs . E_S ###Um , uh , there 's a lot of drugs that *T*-1 go on , and that they just have hopeless lives . E_S ###\[ They , \+ they \] lead themselves down hopeless tunnels . E_S 
22202:11	###And they have also organized fun activities like gyms , * going to the beach , and * playing volleyball at the beach in the summer , E_S ###and they have gyms open . E_S ###And it seems that * the younger 0 you can get them and get them involved *-1 with programs after school *-3 *T*-2 , you might keep them E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###SpeakerA37 . ###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###but \[ you , \+ again , you \] need that one on one like a big brother , trying *-1 to \[ keep the younger kid , \+ you know , tell him , \] hey * stay in school , E_S ###it 'll get better , you know , E_S 
22366:10	###I know it E_S ###but San Antonio is considered *-1 a nice clean city , * believe it or not .

22369:15	###SpeakerA95 . ###I mean , they have all kinds of nice write ups about it E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###oh , yeah , E_S ###\[ but , \+ But \] there 's a lot of them , E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###but any big city has a bad section . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###it 's very prevalent , E_S

E_S ###When we moved here to Monterrey *T*-1 it was a big change , because it 's such a small community , E_S ###we 're just above Carmel , E_S ###and , um , there 's hardly , N_S 
22469:6	###but , uh , the ones 0 I caught *T*-1 were never large enough * to really do anything . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Do they have a limit on sharks , E_S ###I mean , is that like \[ a , \+ a \] sport fish , E_S ###can you actually catch those E_S ###and there 's no limit .

22903:23	###SpeakerA43 . ###Other things . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###and it *EXP*-1 's hard * to , N_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###yeah E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###SpeakerA47 . 
22920:27	###in fact there 's a , N_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###I do too . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###SpeakerA53 . ###Outside 's awful deceiving sometimes you know . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###SpeakerB56 . 
22981:72	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###but of course , I would never be able *-1 to afford *-2 to put my parents in something like that , you know , E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's the problem E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###that 's way out of my reach . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###the expense of it all is , N_S 
23065:11	###Around , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB112 . ###SpeakerA113 . ###But I really do n't know what the other solution would be *T*-1 you know , E_S ###SpeakerB114 . ###No . E_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###I really do n't . E_S ###But no , E_S 
23157:7	###So . N_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah .

23169:51	###Yeah E_S ###see , and , N_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###it *EXP*-1 's not always convenient * to do it . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah , E_S ###see , and here in Lubbock everything 's so close . E_S ###I can imagine what it 's like *T*-1 up there . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah , E_S 
23204:8	###SpeakerA35 . ###it 's not plastic . E_S ###I did n't want *-1 to buy a plastic one . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Yeah E_S ###because those things I think 0 *T*-1 would just snap you know . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###SpeakerA39 .

24253:19	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###I said , uh , I could n't do this everyday . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###SpeakerB68 . ###No way . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Well . N_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###\[ Maybe , \+ maybe \] * being a tenured professor would be one thing ,

E_S ###I think 0 it 's kind of a push * to , uh , weed out drugs in states E_S ###\[ and , \+ because \] I do n't know of any other countries that *T*-1 are doing this E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###and \[ I , \+ I \] feel like it 's really just within the United States . E_S ###\[ It 's , \+ uh , it 's \] okay . E_S 
24539:55	###\[ and , \+ because \] I do n't know of any other countries that *T*-1 are doing this E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###and \[ I , \+ I \] feel like it 's really just within the United States . E_S ###\[ It 's , \+ uh , it 's \] okay . E_S ###I think 0 your record should stand for itself . That , you know , if you 've been tested *-1 at other companies and you 've always come up *-4 negative or whatever , then I do n't see what the big deal is *T*-2 that they have *-3 to go to all the expense of *-6 testing you over and over and over *T*-5 . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . 
24549:18	###And once you 've established the fact that you 're not a drug user and especially if your personality proves that you 're not *?* . I think 0 they could , uh , save money by *-1 not doing that . You know , every time , E_S ###say if you change jobs you would n't have *-1 to do it if you 'd just been tested *-2 at your other work place . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Well , what about random testing , though . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Do you feel like that 's an \[ in- , \+ invasion \] of certain people 's rights if not everyone is tested *-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh , not if it 's done *-1 fairly . E_S 
24563:38	###SpeakerB18 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###and that 's not necessarily fair . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Well , they might tell you 0 it 's random . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###But then , you know , it 's kind of like \[ a , \+ a \] lottery . E_S 
24588:29	###and from that point on , uh , \[ at , \+ \] the N C double A does have something 0 * to do *T*-1 with it , E_S ###but it *ICH*-2 's almost discretionary on the coach 's part of each \[ \[ in- , \+ individu- , \] \+ individual \] institution * to identify the ones that *T*-1 have the problem . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Oh , I see . E_S ###So , do you ... N_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###\[ And , \+ and \] the ones that *T*-1 test positive have *-2 to retest after a certain period of time .

24601:8	###SpeakerB34 . ###SpeakerA35 . ###SpeakerB36 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###but I think 0 that might be a violation of someone 's rights .

27689:38	###SpeakerB108 . ###Well , uh , what about the lighting ? E_S ###Did it make a big difference ? E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###Uh , not particularly E_S ###because the house has so many windows E_S ###SpeakerB110 . ###Oh , uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###uh , it has N_S 
27703:6	###SpeakerB112 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA113 . ###and the lights shine right at our house . E_S ###It 's kind of , N_S ###we did n't know that when we bought the house *T*-1 E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerB114 . ###So that , uh , N_S ###you get some , N_S 
27714:25	###SpeakerA115 . ###Yeah . E_S ###We have a lot of light , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###And , well , \[ \[ \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ it , \] \+ um , well , it 's \] just , \+ uh , I think 0 it 's just \] \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] dark blue to about three feet E_S ###and then above that we left it white E_S ###so .

27716:118	###We have a lot of light , E_S ###yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerA117 . ###but \[ the , \+ the \] interesting thing is 0 that paint we wound up *-1 having *-2 to go back and scrape some of that away E_S ###it did n't , N_S 
27758:12	###I do n't know . E_S ###I grew up , uh , in \[ the , \+ the \] sixties , E_S ###and at that time , uh , it was \[ is \+ \] a changing time for the whole music scene , I guess 0 *T*-1 E_S ###and I grew up with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and the whole pot culture during that time and went through that phase and kind of stayed with it I guess 0 *T*-1 for several years after I graduated from college \[ and , \+ and \] thereafter E_S but have since , uh , N_S ###I grew up in a small town \[ in , \+ in \] southern Oklahoma E_S ###I have kind of gone back to , uh , more of a county , uh , flavor in music . E_S ###Um , I 'm not quite sure why that is *T*-1 E_S ###and it seems like almost a opposite , E_S ###but I guess 0 I got away from what I consider *T*-1 to be the pot , uh , sounding music . E_S ###It did n't have \[ what , \+ you know , I guess 0 *T*-2 what \] I was looking for *T*-1 
27792:10	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###I think 0 \[ with , \+ \] in a way one could talk about Simon and Garfunkel that way because they do tend , uh , *-1 to have a dramatic or story approach to their music , uh , usually tend *-2 to have some good or bad moral to it . E_S ###Uh , over time I became very interested \[ in , \+ in \] baroque classical E_S ###and I think 0 that was just through * experiencing contacting college and the fact that I found \[ it , \+ it \] very relaxing for me . E_S ###My tastes now run I guess 0 *T*-1 to a upbeat , uh , Simon , N_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###it 's something that *T*-1 interests me , uh , combined \[ with , \+ with \] the classical tastes 0 I had mentioned *T*-2 . E_S 
27826:11	###And \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] \[ pretty , \+ fairly \] well easily \[ to \+ uh , uh , something 0 * to \] fall into *T*-1 . E_S ###I 'm kind of the say way , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I 've \] gone through different periods of life , uh , in music from pop to classical . E_S ###I guess 0 one of the things \[ was \+ \] that *T*-1 influenced me was that \[ I , \+ I 've \] worked in radio stations as a D J for all my college years *-2 trying *-3 to support my way through there , E_S and suppor- , N_S was support , N_S ###I was influenced *-1 by all different kinds of music E_S but basically because that 's where I worked *T*-1 . E_S ###And I 've developed a real love for , uh , classical music in , probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was , uh , heavy into classical type music . E_S ###He said 0 he used *-1 to sit on Saturday mornings and watch cartoons just *-3 to hear the music , uh , that they were using *T*-2 behind them because they used , especially Disney used *RNR*-4 a lot of classical music , uh , behind the cartoons E_S ###and so consequently we \[ wind up , \+ wound up \] *-1 playing a lot of classical music there E_S ###and I think 0 that , uh , got deep seated into me . E_S ###One of things 0 I especially like *T*-2 now in music regardless of what kind it is *T*-1 , uh , are those that *T*-3 call on those classical , uh , roots , I guess 0 *T*-4 , 
28013:34	###\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , your kids should be totally happy in day care , because everybody else goes to day care E_S ###SpeakerB15 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###\[ and , \+ and \] we have these wonderful people \[ who *T*-1 are \+ who *T*-2 are \] totally prepared *-3 \[ to tea- , \+ to teach \] your child everything 0 they need *-4 to know *T*-5 in day care E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###SpeakerB19 . ###Yeah , E_S 
28044:10	###I could n't put in enough overtime that *T*-1 was necess- , or \[ that , \+ \] you know , things that *T*-2 would come up at work , that *T*-3 would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on Saturdays \[ as * is , \+ you know , as * is \] needed *-4 , because my husband for a long time was out of the country also \[ with , \+ uh , with \] work , for like three months E_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###SpeakerB29 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB31 . ###So it was you and the kid E_S 
28177:133	###Yeah , E_S ###so jobs have *-1 to , I guess , become more flexible . E_S ###SpeakerA80 . ###I think 0 they 're really going *-1 to have *-2 to *?* , ###\[ and not , \+ and not \] just for mothers , for fathers as well . E_S ###SpeakerB81 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA82 . ###It 's going *-1 to have *-2 to be both . E_S ###SpeakerB83 . 
28183:16	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA82 . ###It 's going *-1 to have *-2 to be both . E_S ###SpeakerB83 . ###Well , \[ so , \+ so \] that 's another thing that *T*-1 has *-2 to adapt is , you know , \[ the , \+ the \] father 's attitudes about , you know , \[ who , \+ whose \] job is this *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA84 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB85 . ###Well , \[ it , \+ it 's \] his job too . E_S ###And I , N_S 
28184:17	###SpeakerA82 . ###It 's going *-1 to have *-2 to be both . E_S ###SpeakerB83 . ###Well , \[ so , \+ so \] that 's another thing that *T*-1 has *-2 to adapt is , you know , \[ the , \+ the \] father 's attitudes about , you know , \[ who , \+ whose \] job is this *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA84 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB85 . ###Well , \[ it , \+ it 's \] his job too . E_S ###And I , N_S ###to me the only important issue is the children , E_S 
28185:29	###It 's going *-1 to have *-2 to be both .

E_S ###And I , N_S ###to me the only important issue is the children , E_S ###because as far as housework goes , you know , men can do housework just as easily as women , E_S 
28272:160	###SpeakerB119 . ###SpeakerA120 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB121 . ###SpeakerA122 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB123 . ###and , uh . N_S ###SpeakerA124 . ###And I think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] going *-1 to show up a lot more now , \[ in the , \+ in the \] next generation \[ of , \+ of \] boys and girls . E_S 
28311:26	###SpeakerB141 . ###and I think 0 that 's happened in a lot of cases . E_S ###SpeakerA142 . ###yeah , E_S ###some kids are really having it . N_S ###If they 'd been in day care the entire time and it was n't , N_S ###yeah , E_S ###the ones that *T*-1 are now getting *-2 to be teenagers and in some cases , young college . E_S ###SpeakerB143 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
28339:12	###and I felt like when they were young *T*-1 , that was the time 0 *-2 to instill it *T*-5 . That \[ it could be , \+ it could be \] added to *-3 and strengthened *-3 as they grew older , but 0 when they were little *T*-4 , you know , N_S ###SpeakerB151 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA152 . ###this is the way 0 I feel *T*-1 about this , E_S ###and this is the way , because \[ \[ I , \+ it 's \] \+ that , \] you know , N_S ###\[ \[ \[ when you , \+ when you , \] \+ if you , \] \+ if you \] teach them when they 're little *T*-1 the way 0 you want them to be *T*-2 , and the things that *T*-3 are important to you , then \[ you just , \+ you \] add onto it as they get older . E_S ###SpeakerB153 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA154 . 
28421:29	###SpeakerA17 . ###Huh-uh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###I also use my P C *-1 to emulate a mainframe terminal for our I B M mainframe and also to emulate a deck terminal for our deck machine .

28461:52	###SpeakerA35 . ###Huh-uh .

28605:6	###SpeakerA95 . ###Um , we 're just trying *-1 to talk ours into *-2 getting a laser printer . E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###Yeah .

28709:18	###SpeakerB138 . ###* Come on guys , E_S ###this is crummy .

E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Okay , E_S ###um , I like *-1 to do , uh , weight training \[ and , \+ and \] cycling . And just walking , uh , swimming . E_S ###I used *-1 to do a lot of basketball and running and volleyball until I had some knee surgery last fall . E_S 
28764:13	###I used *-1 to do a lot of basketball and running and volleyball until I had some knee surgery last fall .

E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Well , * let me ask a personal question , E_S ###how old are you *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Thirty-eight . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Oh , well then you should E_S 
28816:51	###SpeakerB24 . ###SpeakerA25 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###or it 's the geriatric crowd . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###So , I 've considered even *-1 becoming licensed * to teach it . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . 
28842:25	###I can believe that . E_S ###Have you tried \[ the , \+ uh , the \] pool at the Spring Creek Fitness Center ? E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###No , E_S ###and you know , that 's the only place I have n't tried E_S ###and people have told me . E_S ###Now that 's the Texins facility ? E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . 
28984:68	###and I 'll tell you how they handled this *T*-1 E_S ###and I was just outraged , E_S ###I did not know that since I was on personal leave of absence that I had been , uh , terminated *-1 until I filed my insurance claims about four months later E_S ###and they did n't have any coverage under my name E_S ###and I went back E_S ###and I said what the hell *T*-1 is going on here , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###Yeah , E_S ###really . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . 
29008:6	###There you go . E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###I was just pissed as hell that they could do that . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] can believe that . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###But \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 things have gotten better , E_S ###I 've been told that this flex hour and those kind of things , N_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S 
29086:10	###SpeakerA121 . ###Oh , I do n't think 0 that would be bad at all . E_S ###If you 're in Richardson you 'd probably wanted *-1 to come \[ to the , \+ to the \] Dallas site . E_S ###SpeakerB122 . ###Oh , I 'm actually right on the Plano line . E_S ###SpeakerA123 . ###Oh , well , then you could go either one , E_S ###SpeakerB124 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA125 . 
29121:99	###All righty . E_S ###Um , well , I , uh , have a four year old who *T*-1 will just be entering public school next year , E_S ###so I 'm really just starting *-1 to get involved *-2 \[ in , \+ uh , in \] what *T*-3 's out there and how they do things *T*-4 . E_S ###Um , as far as the system as a whole , I really do n't see a problem with it . E_S ###I do see a problem with * graduating people \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 ca n't read and are not , you know , productive in society or productive to themselves E_S ###and , uh , I think 0 that 's the main problem at this point . E_S ###How about yourself ? E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###All right . E_S ###I \[ 'm , \+ live \] in Plano , Texas E_S 
29168:135	###SpeakerB15 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###Teaching these kids 0 , you know , \[ how \+ \] MUMBLEx really the basics is what it comes down to *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###Exactly . E_S ###I was astonished *-1 *-1 to find out \[ that , \+ that \] across the United States in all public schools it *EXP*-2 is not mandatory for them to take phys ed . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###Is that right ? E_S ###SpeakerB19 . 
29309:17	###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###but , um , I would always end up *-1 arriving at work *-3 late , because I would always end up *-2 skimming the headlines , spending too much time , *-4 reading it in the morning . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###So I have *-1 to cut myself down to the weekend , plus after work . E_S 
29316:42	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###So I have *-1 to cut myself down to the weekend , plus after work . E_S ###Um , the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour is on public television E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###and I enjoy that quite a bit . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Yeah . E_S 
29335:77	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###He 's very , very skeptical of the news media , E_S ###and I will admit 0 I 'm reasonably skeptical also . E_S ###But \[ he 's , \+ I do n't know , uh , he 's \] \[ \[ mu- , \+ much , \] \+ much \] more so . E_S ###It 's sort of interesting though , because he does bring \[ a , \+ a \] much , um , different perspective with all the Gulf goings on , um . E_S ###He was always speaking in terms of , you know , American imperialism reasserting itself . E_S ###Um , I suppose 0 it 's a different attitude that we normally do n't hear *T*-1 in the country . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
29401:67	###SpeakerB54 . ###I will admit 0 it 's interesting . E_S ###\[ \[ I- , \+ I- , \] \+ I 'm \] twenty-six . E_S ###So I do n't have any more experience in that than you . E_S ###Um , \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ it *EXP*-3 \] was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe 0 * to grind *T*-1 , you know , E_S ###there were some that *T*-1 were screaming for air power , E_S ###there were some that *T*-1 were saying 0 the air power was n't going *-2 to do it . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . 
29554:6	###SpeakerB108 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###It 's piddly stuff 0 * to pick a newspaper over *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerB110 . ###SpeakerA111 . ###and I enjoy , N_S ###the comics are better in this newspaper . E_S ###SpeakerB112 . ###SpeakerA113 . 
29571:24	###SpeakerB116 . ###I figure 0 I 'm only taking on the weekend , E_S ###and I can afford that . E_S ###SpeakerA117 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB118 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] find the news reporting in the MORNING NEWS to be better , E_S ###but I sort of have a liberal political slant , E_S ###and the MORNING NEWS just has an incredibly conservative editorial , um , outlook . E_S ###SpeakerA119 . 
29781:19	###I was just . N_S ###There 's bound *-1 to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that *T*-2 's very similar that *T*-3 's not going *-4 to melt too much with , uh , uh , high humidity , in a room , E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###SpeakerA63 . ###\[ That 's \+ I think 0 that 's \] what my concern was *T*-1 , was it really sure , and \[ how they would , \+ how they would \] last *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###SpeakerA65 . ###SpeakerB66 . 
29879:27	###I do know . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###I have done a little bit of that , E_S ###but I decided that that 's something that *T*-1 demands \[ my tim- , \+ \[ my , \+ my \] total \] attention . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###And so I 've got *-1 to have \[ total , \+ almost total \] silence . E_S 
30053:104	###But , uh , \[ I try , \+ \[ a- , \+ as \] with the American Express , I try \] *-1 to pay it , you know , as it comes in . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Right . E_S ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###So , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###\[ It 's , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill . E_S ###That 's usually how we do it *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . 
30214:21	###So , when I heard that Jack was going *-1 to do this *T*-2 , I called him and asked for an application where I could participate in this *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###And , so that 's how I got involved *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA107 . ###Yeah . E_S ###You have a \[ very , \+ um , very , \] N_S ###what 's the word *T*-1 . E_S 
30391:69	###So . N_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Right . E_S ###She could just as easily do those things by hand . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Yeah , E_S ###just as quickly . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . 
30476:4	###SpeakerB72 . ###Well , yeah , E_S ###I . N_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###She could n't imagine *-1 going through college without a computer . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Well I 'm going through right now . E_S ###I 'm , you know , going part time in the evenings , E_S ###and , you know , I do , N_S ###yeah , E_S 
30880:21	###SpeakerA63 . ###Well , I have no objections to it . E_S ###It 's just , uh , N_S ###and it 's a matter of your taste , uh , E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###It 's just that , N_S ###yeah , E_S 
30997:42	###All the tricks . E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###SpeakerB104 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###That sounds like an interesting concept . E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###But you need *-1 to rent the first one first . E_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###* To understand what *T*-1 's going on in the second ? E_S ###SpeakerA107 . 
31149:49	###SpeakerA28 . ###And somebody said , well , you know , you could go in \[ and , \+ and \] substitute teach at seventy-five dollars a day E_S ###and there 's always going *-1 to be , you know , somebody having a need for a math or science teacher . E_S ###I thought , Christ , they 're letting me in , * to , you know , N_S ###SpeakerB29 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###\[ this would be , \+ this would be \] frightening . E_S ###I do n't know anything about it . E_S ###SpeakerB31 . 
31160:62	###SpeakerA32 . ###SpeakerB33 . ###SpeakerA34 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB35 . ###SpeakerA36 . ###Right . E_S ###And even if I knew how * to teach the subject matter *T*-1 , I do n't know if I 'd know how * to handle that kind of \[ a , \+ a \] group of kids *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S 
31184:33	###What I 'm seeing *T*-1 now , uh , in terms of kindergarten preparedness , just from , \[ \[ in , \+ in , \] \+ in \] different preschools it 's like day and night . E_S ###SpeakerB43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA44 . ###And I wonder , how do they handle a child who *T*-1 is obviously very ready and another child who *T*-2 does n't even speak English , let alone know her colors *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB45 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA46 . ###And they 're in the same classrooms . E_S ###And I guess also 0 you 're going *-1 to see the first of the , uh , crack kids starting kindergarten . E_S 
31227:9	###SpeakerA58 . ###Well , you know , \[ you , \+ you \] sit here E_S ###and you think about that . E_S ###At the same time you think , God , I hope 0 I do n't sound like a stage mother because , right now if you ask my friends t- , put twenty mothers in a room and ask them how many *T*-2 have gifted children , you 're going *-1 to have twenty hands , you know , up there . E_S ###SpeakerB59 . ###SpeakerA60 . ###SpeakerB61 . ###Oh , you 're kidding . E_S ###SpeakerA62 . ###Oh , no . E_S 
31227:20	###SpeakerA58 . ###Well , you know , \[ you , \+ you \] sit here E_S ###and you think about that .

E_S ###SpeakerB59 . ###SpeakerA60 . ###SpeakerB61 . ###Oh , you 're kidding . E_S ###SpeakerA62 . ###Oh , no . E_S 
31277:68	###and , uh , I was just absolutely shocked , uh , the first time that I saw his schoolwork *T*-1 . E_S ###Uh , I remember *-1 being , you know , taught *-2 , E_S ###and I think , you know , you have *-1 to teach how * to write an answer *T*-2 and , you know , how * to construct a thought process *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB75 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA76 . ###And , you know , \[ they can get a , \+ they can \] grasp the points . E_S ###Can they convey the data verbally or in writing . E_S ###And that 's what *T*-1 's , you know , really scary to me . E_S ###Uh , I would really , you know , N_S 
31337:40	###So , I do n't know . E_S ###SpeakerB95 . ###SpeakerA96 . ###You know , it does make me nervous . E_S ###SpeakerB97 . ###Well , I can see why if you 've got little ones just coming along . E_S ###There 's \[ a , \+ a \] whole lot of stuff 0 *T*-1 going on out there . E_S ###SpeakerA98 . ###There is a whole lot of stuff 0 *T*-1 going on out there E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] part of me says 0 I just would like *-1 to , you know , shut my eyes and pretend 0 it does n't , you know , go on .

31437:46	###On the other hand , um , I think 0 there 's certainly some professions that *T*-1 ought *-2 to be tested *-3 because \[ of the , \+ of their \] responsibility for the public welfare , and certainly people in , uh , industries , well , the transportation industry , \[ for spe- , \+ uh , you know , specifically . \] E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###SpeakerA37 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###SpeakerA39 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . 
31472:27	###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###I mean , you do n't know whether the person sitting next to you anywhere is on drugs or not , E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###SpeakerB54 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###and it takes some drastic steps at this point . E_S 
31512:48	###and it 's the son and so on , E_S ###and he was friends with my children um , E_S ###and he 's really the only one that I know of *T*-1 personally who *T*-2 got himself really messed *-3 up , um , * \[ ha- , \+ having \] been involved *-4 with drugs . E_S ###But I know of a number of other people who *T*-1 have , you know , gotten all messed *-2 up . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Most of these are young people . E_S ###I work in the education system E_S ###and so I have a little more contact with that . E_S 
31584:60	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###because it makes a bigger problem . Um , E_S ###so it seems to me \[ that , \+ that , \] um , there needs *-1 to be \[ some ground , \+ you know , some rules \] that *T*-2 protect . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###I 'm not sure *ICH*-4 , though , when we talk about what rules , if any *T*-3 , that we should say , well , certain segments should not have *-1 to be tested *-2 . E_S ###I really do n't see why , E_S ###SpeakerA97 . 
31605:10	###and it *EXP*-2 may be , you know , N_S 0 it *EXP*-1 's not feasible * to do everyone , E_S ###but certainly random testing , the fact that people know \[ that , \+ that \] they , N_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###That it could happen . E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###Yeah , E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###would be some measure of protection . N_S 
31726:6	###We 'll start them inside E_S ###and , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###In cold frames or whatever the , N_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , we usually start them right in the house . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . 
31771:11	###so , N_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Okay , E_S ###because that kind of moderates the weather a little bit ? E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###We are a little lucky . E_S 
31848:6	###Well , I guess 0 we have *-1 to get back to hobbies since , N_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Yeah , E_S ###we 're getting to where , we 're straying *T*-3 , I guess 0 *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Stick on the subject . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Well , interesting thing that I do *T*-1 is with , gardening , uh , E_S 
31858:30	###my sister grows flowers that you can dry *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###and you can make \[ fl- , \+ uh , dried flower \] arrangements E_S ###and you can get real handy with the hot glue gun . E_S ###And we made some really nice Christmas wreaths with , uh , dried red flowers and dried white flowers and , uh , eucalyptus . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Huh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . 
32051:6	###\[ It , \+ it \] just kind of depends on \[ what you 're , \+ what you 're \] planting *T*-1 , E_S ###but , uh all the shrubs and , N_S ###SpeakerA139 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and , uh , when you have time 0 * to do it *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB140 . ###SpeakerA141 . ###SpeakerB142 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA143 . 
32066:4	###She spends lots of money on them . E_S ###And I guess 0 a lot of people \[ do , \+ do \] do that . E_S ###They landscape their whole house with flower gardens . E_S ###SpeakerB146 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA147 . ###She 's got like , just a small patch of lawn and just flowers and mulch \[ ba- , \+ tree bark \] all over her lawn . E_S ###SpeakerB148 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ Flowers , \+ during the summer down here , \[ the , \+ the \] normal kind of flowers , \] there 's very few of them that *T*-1 will really do well . E_S 
32110:59	###Now where is this *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA161 . ###Uh , it 's in Georgia . E_S ###SpeakerB162 . ###In Georgia , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA163 . ###\[ It 's , \+ yeah , it 's \] right outside of Macon , E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] it 's just a , N_S 
32136:4	###\[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] uh , not dry at all . E_S ###\[ It , \+ it 's \] humid . E_S ###SpeakerA169 . ###Well , where is it *T*-1 , E_S ###\[ is it Hous- , \+ was n't it Houston 0 *T*-1 's \] humid ? E_S ###SpeakerB170 . ###\[ Hu- , \+ Houston \] is awful . E_S ###SpeakerA171 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB172 . 
32628:10	###SpeakerA213 . ###Yeah , E_S ###SpeakerB214 . ###SpeakerA215 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB216 . ###But , uh , you know , you can improve your own soil there E_S ###SpeakerA217 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB218 . 
32686:15	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB240 . ###SpeakerA241 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###It would be handy . E_S ###SpeakerB242 . ###And it weighs twenty pounds or , something like that . E_S ###SpeakerA243 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB244 . 
32789:15	###and I could n't find a nursery that *T*-1 had any of them left *-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB284 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA285 . ###But we 've got some this year . E_S ###SpeakerB286 . ###Uh , those , N_S ###SpeakerA287 . ###Snow peas are up E_S 
32853:11	###SpeakerB316 . ###Right . E_S ###We froze a lot of peppers . E_S ###We let some turn red . E_S ###SpeakerA317 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Uh-huh . E_S ###We did that too , E_S ###SpeakerB318 . ###And some we do *T*-1 *-2 green E_S 
33032:21	###SpeakerB14 . ###Oh , really . E_S ###Well , I guess 0 * being from that part of the country . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Because , I mean , crawfish , everybody over here likes crawfish E_S ###but you know , \[ I , \+ I \] would n't have *-1 to worry about *-2 satisfying my guest . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###But if it was a formal dinner party I would probably think of something else like , uh , N_S 
33061:68	###I mean , well , you eat them *-1 dead E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###but , N_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###* Do n't buy them *-1 that way . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Right . E_S ###Because \[ if , \+ if \] they are dead for too long , N_S 
33074:12	###SpeakerA31 . ###And you 're not supposed *-1 to eat those because they 're bad for you . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Okay . E_S ###Well , I 'll remember that . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah , E_S ###so if you ever go in a restaurant , * order crawfish , E_S ###I mean , every once in a while you 'll see on- , E_S ###I mean , it does n't happen very often because it 's just an accident E_S 
33103:57	###SpeakerB40 . ###Um-hum . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Like \[ if , \+ like my age , ###if \] there was a bunch of college kids coming over for a dinner party , no , \[ I , \+ they \] would shell their own , E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###you know , we 'd just have crawfish and beer or something E_S ###but , um , if it was more formal like if I was , you know , working environment then I would probably , um , \[ sh- , \+ shell \] 'em or at least disconnect them from the head . E_S 
33148:42	###SpeakerA59 . ###Just um The crawfish I mean it just has a taste of its own E_S ###It also depends on who *T*-1 's cooking it and how much seasoning they use *T*-2 stuff like that E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Sure E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###but um I think that N_S ###And also * to get totally off the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party I think that that really helps E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Yeah . E_S 
33332:11	###SpeakerA159 . ###that would be wonderful E_S ###SpeakerB160 . ###* makes them a little bit crunchy E_S ###you need *-1 to chop em up *-2 real fine E_S ###SpeakerA161 . ###Yeah E_S ###SpeakerB162 . ###But um it makes them crunchy E_S ###and that adds something new to it E_S 
33467:4	###SpeakerB2 . ###Oh , no . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###I ripped the ligaments in my right ankle . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Gosh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah E_S ###so , N_S ###SpeakerB6 . 
33512:12	###At least since they 've redone it , supposedly redone . E_S ###So I do n't really , N_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ it- , \+ well , it 's \] not that great , E_S ###and I go to the Spring Creek one on and off . E_S ###But my husband 's working over there E_S ###and he just goes to the Dallas one . E_S ###But I just do n't , N_S ###I mean , it 's just so much weight lifting . E_S 
33833:8	###Yeah . E_S ###There some things 0 I 'd like *-1 to try *T*-2 , E_S ###but , you know , sometime when I ask *T*-1 , I just feel like , boy , am I stupid or what . E_S ###SpeakerB128 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Well that 's one thing 0 I like *T*-1 about the Spring Creek place . E_S ###At least \[ the fellow that *T*-2 's there , \+ one of the fellows that *T*-1 's there \] at night and on weekends is real helpful . E_S ###SpeakerA129 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB130 . 
33962:11	###Uh , well what would you say 0 your opinion *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 on gun control ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , I do n't know . E_S ###\[ I 've , \+ I 've \] had mixed emotions *ICH*-4 , I guess 0 *T*-3 , when I listen to , uh , the radio \[ and , \+ and \] watch T V *T*-2 about the different , uh , things that *T*-1 are happening . E_S ###Uh , I 'm against it E_S ###but on the same token , uh , I went out and purchased a gun just because I wanted the right * to do that . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Ye- , N_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###So \[ I , \+ I \] have a rifle in the house . E_S 
33982:11	###It 's a little twenty-two E_S ###and I have a twenty-two or a twelve gauge shotgun . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###An- , you know , I do like *-1 to have my guns . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###SpeakerA11 . ###Uh , I do n't know if I 'll ever use it , you know . E_S ###And like you , my bullets to my little pistol 's probably , uh , about three years old . E_S 
34042:5	###That was n't \[ too , \+ too \] bad . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###No . E_S ###No . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Because \[ if , \+ if \] you 're going *-1 to go *-2 buy something , uh , uh , of that nature , I think 0 \[ you , \+ you 're \] going *-3 to have some idea as to what you 're going *-4 to do *T*-5 with it . E_S ###You 're not going *-1 to react that quickly . E_S ###In other words , you know , you do n't have a need * to go *-1 buy a gun *-3 to go *-2 shoot it the next day . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Th- , N_S 
34049:6	###In other words , you know , you do n't have a need * to go *-1 buy a gun *-3 to go *-2 shoot it the next day .

E_S ###They both do the same kind of job . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . 
34049:22	###In other words , you know , you do n't have a need * to go *-1 buy a gun *-3 to go *-2 shoot it the next day .

34072:8	###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh , it 's , you know , N_S ###you have a little , uh , thing *ICH*-2 \[ on the \[ bo- , \+ bottom \] of th- , \+ on top of the barrel \] where \[ you , \+ you \] turn it *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Uh-huh .

34076:57	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###And the spread changes .

34220:21	###SpeakerA97 . ###SpeakerB98 . ###and , uh , I do n't know why I never registered it *T*-1 E_S ###but the , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###I do n't think 0 you have *-1 to register a shotgun .

34230:6	###Well , see , uh , my husband has a thing .

34258:71	###And , that 's true . E_S ###SpeakerA113 . ###Uh , I , N_S ###\[ bu- , \+ bu- , \] you know , they know so , how much money *ICH*-2 you make *T*-1 a week to , uh , probably your , uh , N_S ###my kid is banging .

34333:4	###SpeakerB140 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA141 . ###You know . And I 'm sure 0 it 'd be even less for somebody with a good gun . E_S ###SpeakerB142 . ###Huh . ###And I think 0 the Federal government \[ is , \+ uh , is \] really far away from , uh , uh , control . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] do n't believe in , uh , N_S ###\[ I 'm s- , \+ I should n't \] probably say control . E_S ###I mean regulation . E_S 
34362:9	###Okay , E_S ###so what kind of movies have you seen *T*-1 , lately , I guess ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Um , a lot , N_S ###well , the last movie 0 I saw *T*-1 , but it was n't my choice , was the NINJA TURTLE movie . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Obviously you have kids . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###That 's right . E_S ###Yeah , E_S 
34437:79	###SpeakerB32 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Other than the , N_S ###I assume 0 you were talking about the new NINJA TURTLES . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Yes , E_S ###the new one , of course . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Is that any good , E_S 
34551:19	###I mean , \[ there , \+ there \] were times when \[ he was , \+ like , he 'd \] be running with a gun or whatever *T*-1 . E_S ###He did n't look like a cop when he did it *T*-1 . E_S ###And I was so impressed with that because , you know , usually , N_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###That 's neat . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###SpeakerB74 . ###The part *ICH*-1 was hard , * to do that . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Oh yeah , E_S 
34706:12	###yeah , E_S ###SpeakerB138 . ###SpeakerA139 . ###And then if you want popcorn and stuff \[ it 's \+ just , I mean , uh , it 's incredible . \] ###No , E_S ###SpeakerB140 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA141 . ###SpeakerB142 . ###I do n't understand why they charge you out the kazoo for both *T*-1 . E_S 
34850:6	###they really do n't . E_S ###SpeakerB194 . ###Okay , E_S ###okay . E_S ###SpeakerA195 . ###And I think 0 it 's an excellent movie for , N_S ###\[ if , \+ if \] she enjoys movies I think 0 *T*-1 it 'll work pretty good . E_S ###SpeakerB196 . ###Oh , that 'll be good . E_S ###We really need some , E_S 
35081:37	###SpeakerA64 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB65 . ###But it 's , just one of those things , you know , E_S ###you have *-1 to shut your eyes or not listen or something , because those drive you crazy , \[ if you 're , \+ if you 're \] in the room . E_S ###\[ So , \+ But \] it 's such a shame , because it could be so good . E_S ###SpeakerA66 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB67 . 
35194:63	###SpeakerB107 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] enjoy that , E_S ###but \[ \[ what do you , \+ where do you \] \+ do you \] get that come- . N_S ###SpeakerA108 . ###Well yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB109 . ###You do n't have cable now , E_S ###I was going *-1 to say 0 they have a comedy channel now . E_S ###But again you 're in a situation where you 're watching mostly , uh , commercials *T*-1 , E_S 
35345:8	###so what kind of cars are you looking at *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , \[ \[ we 've , \+ uh , we 've , \] \+ we 've \] test driven the Oldsmobile Delta Eighty-eight and a Cutlass Supreme and a used Cadillac , about three or four years old because , uh , I get married *-1 in a couple of weeks E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###and I have two kids E_S 
35447:38	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###But when they 're three years old *T*-1 they 're , N_S ###the price already drops in half . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###So then it becomes , uh , more realistic . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Right . E_S 
35625:13	###\[ So , \+ but , \] uh , it runs fine , E_S ###all 0 you hav- , N_S ###it 's just very thirsty . E_S ###SpeakerA125 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB126 . ###If I just keep the oil in , it seems *-1 to be okay . E_S ###But , you know , that 's a sign that I 'm going *-1 to have *-2 to do something sooner or later . E_S ###SpeakerA127 . ###Right . E_S 
35836:14	###SpeakerB10 . ###I do n't know about the young women , E_S ###I do n't know if they have *-1 to serve in the military , too . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Yeah , E_S ###a lot , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###well , you take Israel E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###SpeakerA13 . 
36211:20	###SpeakerA153 . ###I mean , one 's import- , N_S ###I mean , on the other hand , I mean , you take a garbage man in New York City 0 *T*-1 starts out at twenty-six thousand dollars . E_S ###SpeakerB154 . ###That 's pretty good . E_S ###SpeakerA155 . ###Well I bet you 0 there 's a whole bunch of homeless people up there who *T*-1 would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year . E_S ###SpeakerB156 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA157 . 
36343:21	###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###How about you . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Um , the only exercise program 0 I 'm doing *T*-1 right now is walking . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###I 've got a nine month old , E_S ###and I 'm four months pregnant with my second , E_S 
36465:14	###I understand . E_S ###Did you exercise between your first child and your second ? E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###I exercised pretty well up \[ until I found , \+ uh , until \] I was pregnant , E_S ###and I started *-1 having pains . E_S ###So I 've calmed down everything except , I was working out doing aerobic exercises as well as the , um , walking , E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###And I had *-1 to stop the aerobics because it was just kind of painful . E_S 
36631:57	###and \[ we , \+ we \] went up there *-1 to hopefully be able *-2 to get on the water a little bit E_S ###but \[ it was still , \+ uh , it was still , \] too , cold . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Oh , really ? E_S ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ it , \+ it \] was pretty early in the year . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Um , yeah , E_S 
36641:8	###up here you got *-1 to wait until , \[ Aug- , \+ August , \] until the water warms up . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Well , it 's not that bad E_S ###but it 's still pretty chilly . E_S ###Um , I do n't know , E_S ###\[ I was , \+ I have \] a tent E_S ###and I fluff out in it , in the backyard and stuff , E_S ###but this thing about camping that *T*-1 bothers me is 0 you 've got *-2 to pack everything E_S

36712:6	###Uh , but , there 's this one campsite , that *T*-1 it , N_S ###just some of them are known E_S ###but there is one that *T*-1 's out in this big lake E_S ###and \[ \[ its , \+ its , \] \+ its , \] mosquitoes are terrible E_S ###and then \[ there 's this , \+ there 's this \] other one that *T*-1 's more up in the mountains E_S ###but it surrounds a man-made reservoir E_S ###and there 's no bugs , E_S ###that 's the whole thing that everyone told me *T*-1 , oh , E_S ###\[ I 'm , \+ I was \] going *-1 to go to , \[ Lit- , \+ Little \] River State Park , E_S ###MUMBLEx 
36733:82	###SpeakerB40 . ###Really ?

36812:6	###SpeakerA59 . ###I do n't know E_S ###but that sounds that \[ my , \+ my \] kind of camping , ###it really does .

36911:71	###\[ just , \+ just , \] N_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###They have them right at the campsites ? E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ they 're , \+ they 're \] lean-tos . E_S ###\[ They 're , \+ um , Yeah , they 're \] pretty nice , E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###Wow . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . 
36922:6	###and the one time that we went , we got one *T*-1 , E_S it was overlooking the water E_S ###but it was a big embankment , E_S ###I wanted *-1 to get one right on the water .

36939:14	###Um , I think 0 their biggest problem is just , you know , * obtaining food 0 * to live *T*-1 , E_S ###so when you have the basic needs , uh , being unmet * *T*-1 , I do n't think 0 you think globally as far as , you know , * being a threat to other people in the world .

E_S ###\[ Tha- , \+ that 's \] incredible E_S ###but they had *-1 to , uh , go in the direction of a market driven economy , E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] they had *-1 to bite the bullet for that .

36984:27	###\[ and , \+ and \] they had *-1 to bite the bullet for that . E_S ###So that 's a good move , \[ on , \+ on \] Gorbachev 's part in * doing that . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Uh-huh .

36995:85	###but I do n't know how convinced *ICH*-1 the people are *T*-2 of him yet , myself . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Well , that 's all 0 they got *T*-1 right now . E_S ###That 's their ray of hope . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###So , you know , they 'll go with , you know , whoever *T*-1 comes through for them . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . 
37026:25	###SpeakerA37 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###And in the long-term , N_S ###but I just think that because of the basic needs that the people do n't have *T*-1 , N_S ###I think 0 that , uh , makes the problem most severe , and makes him \[ look , \+ look \] worse that \[ what his , \+ um , what his \] ideals are *T*-1 , personally . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###SpeakerB40 . ###SpeakerA41 . ###I agree . E_S 
37052:72	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###\[ And , \+ but \] if it gets to a point where people ca n't , survive *T*-1 , I mean , there 's revolution .

37105:48	###SpeakerB66 . ###So the original question , ###do we think 0 they 're \[ a threat to our , \+ you know , a security threat ? \] E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Um , yes and no . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I can go with that answer too . E_S 
37196:19	###SpeakerB28 . ###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh , I think 0 sometimes other things suffer ###and tha- , N_S ###I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's hard * to find a balance there . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###But in some ways I think 0 we are expected *-1 to do it all . E_S ###You 're almost looked down upon *-2 if you do n't try *-1 to do all of these things E_S 
37402:43	###and I adopted the Royals , E_S ###I lived in Houston for two and a half years E_S ###so I adopted \[ the , \+ uh , uh , the \] Houston Astros , E_S ###so I mean , you know , I 've got quite a few . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Well do you keep up with the statistical stuff ? E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###No , E_S ###\[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] get into that too much , E_S ###\[ eve- , \+ every \] once in a while , I will keep \[ in , \+ in \] touch , with maybe , like who *T*-1 's in the top five of hitting , or something like that E_S 
37429:34	###Well I did n't know that , E_S ###that 's supposed *-1 to be a real good statistic , uh . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Well , \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ it \] is *?* E_S ###but \[ it 's the , \+ \[ it 's , \+ it 's a \] \] reverse indicator . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Well that 's true , E_S ###they do n't have the offense 0 * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] get out , or to have \[ the , \+ the \] more runs *T*-1 , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerB18 . 
37466:44	###I mean , uh , I think \[ that , \+ uh , that \] a player ought *-1 to hit a home run if he 's got the pitch 0 * to do it *T*-2 , E_S ###but when you get two strikes on you *T*-1 , \[ you have a tend- , \+ you know , you should , you know , shorten \] your swing a little bit , you know , E_S ###if it 's a perfect shot , * go for it , E_S ###but I mean , you know , the strike outs were a big problem for him , E_S ###\[ and , \+ uh , plus \] supposedly what I heard *T*-1 , he was not much of a team player anyway , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Well \[ it , \+ it 's \] an interesting concept , though , when you look at , uh , \[ of , \+ of \] \[ how baseball , \+ how apparently , \] N_S ###I was reading in the paper tonight that the Detroit Tigers are going *-1 to sign him . E_S ###\[ And , \+ uh , and \] the point \[ of , \+ of , \] I guess , N_S 
37492:11	###It does n't , N_S ###\[ \[ he can , \+ he can stri- , \] \+ he can swing \] a couple times , MUMBLEx E_S ###if he fouls it up he can swing as much as he can *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###It 's \[ an interesting , \+ uh , an interesting \] concept \[ of , \+ of \] how they do it *T*-1 . E_S ###But I agree with you E_S ###\[ I think 0 that , \+ I think 0 that 's \] part of what , uh , baseball needs more of *T*-1 . E_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ uh , I , \] \+ I \] guess 0 what *T*-1 bothers me \[ is , \+ is \] that when you go *T*-2 , um , you wait and wait and wait E_S 
37493:23	###\[ \[ he can , \+ he can stri- , \] \+ he can swing \] a couple times , MUMBLEx E_S ###if he fouls it up he can swing as much as he can *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Right .

E_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ uh , I , \] \+ I \] guess 0 what *T*-1 bothers me \[ is , \+ is \] that when you go *T*-2 , um , you wait and wait and wait E_S ###and finally a guy gets up there and blasts a home run E_S 
37537:44	###SpeakerB42 . ###Well I go to Saint Louis from time to time E_S ###and \[ I watch , \+ \[ I , \+ I \] watch \] their sports up there E_S ###and \[ they 're , \+ uh , they 're \] certainly intense about the Cardinals ###they , N_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . ###Oh yeah , E_S 
37544:19	###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . ###Oh yeah , E_S ###baseball \[ is their , \+ is their \] life up there like football is *?* down here I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###\[ Y- , \+ did you \] actually live in Saint Louis ? E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###I lived in the suburbs of Saint Louis , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . 
37590:22	###But if they were , uh , playing the people that they 're going *-1 to play *T*-2 , then that might be pretty good indication , E_S ###so , you know , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] not a great indication because there have been teams that *T*-1 have just , you know , come out and just won all kinds of games in Spring \[ crani- , \+ training \] and then gone on a , you know , fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season E_S ###so , N_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###You know what I think 0 *T*-1 is remarkable is , uh , N_S ###it seems that what you really need *-1 to do *T*-2 *-3 to win though , is * to have a team that *T*-4 has reasonable talent and has some people that *T*-5 \[ \[ have , \+ have , \] \+ have \] real breakthrough years . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Exactly , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . 
37630:10	###that 's part of it , E_S ###I , uh , N_S ###that was part of Skip Bayless ' argument . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###I do n't know if you read Skip Bayless , \[ but \+ \] \[ a , \+ a \] local commentary E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###No . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . 
37630:27	###that 's part of it , E_S ###I , uh , N_S ###that was part of Skip Bayless ' argument . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###I do n't know if you read Skip Bayless , \[ but \+ \] \[ a , \+ a \] local commentary E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###No . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . 
37661:11	###And I think 0 that 's really what *T*-1 's been hurting , uh , the , uh , Rangers . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Well did n't Kansas City put up quite a bit of money for their pitching staff . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###Oh yeah , E_S ###\[ they , \+ they \] spent more money *ICH*-1 , last year than any other team \[ in the , \+ in the \] league E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###SpeakerA87 . ###and they were , you know , toward the bottom of the league . E_S ###Uh , so it 's like I said 
37717:82	###I mean \[ they 're a , \+ it 's a \] small market E_S ###and yet they attract as many if not more than \[ most , \+ uh , uh , most , \] other cities , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###Yeah , E_S ###but do n't you think 0 \[ there 's a , \+ \[ there , \+ there \] are \] older fans there . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] do n't mean older , um , you know , E_S ###the fact \[ that , \+ that \] \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a better established and that \[ the , \+ the \] city \[ \[ is , \+ is , \] \+ is \] more , of a ... N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , E_S 
37924:60	###and that was , N_S ###well \[ I was , \+ I graduated \] high school in nineteen seventy-nine , E_S ###so . N_S That was what , twelve years ago , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###SpeakerB70 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###So , you know , it 's lot different now . E_S 
38013:6	###I have one at , uh , N_S ###the company 0 I work for *T*-1 furnishes , E_S ###so I can work at home . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Oh , wow . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###And it 's just an \[ old , \+ old \] compact , that *T*-1 is super slow E_S ###\[ and , \+ but \] \[ it does , \+ it does \] its job , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerA5 . 
38040:6	###It 's basically just data entry and * running , you know , \[ some , \+ some \] software E_S ###so it does n't really have *-1 to be anything sophisticated , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Huh , ###yeah , E_S ###I do n't own a P C E_S ###but \[ \[ I 've , \+ I 've , \] \+ yeah , I \] work for T I E_S ###and , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Yeah , E_S 
38071:28	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###I mean , \[ I , \+ I \] always say that I need *-1 to buy a computer for the house E_S ###but I just have n't got around to *-1 doing it yet . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###I 'd like *-1 to have one for the house , too , E_S ###but sometimes MUMBLEx \[ my husband , \+ my husband \] says usually , I work on the computer all day at work , E_S ###I do n't want *-1 to come home and have *-2 to work on one , too . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . 
38208:11	###SpeakerA71 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ they 're , \+ they 're \] pretty handy because , you know , when I travel *T*-1 , it *EXP*-2 's easy * to check messages , E_S ###* just , you know , plug in the phone to your computer and dial in E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Uh-huh .

38471:6	###bye , bye . E_S ###SpeakerA157 . ###Bye . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Okay , E_S ###that made a nice ugly sound . E_S ###So , N_S ###SpeakerA3 . 
38655:10	###and I did n't get \[ into , \+ involved in \] that one as well . E_S ###There 's another one 0 he wrote *T*-1 that *T*-2 even sounds better , E_S ###and it 's kind of the whole concept of global peace , you know , like , and \[ communities \+ * building communities . \] E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Uh-huh .

38686:25	###MUMBLEx ?

38823:17	###I was trying *-1 to think of some \[ while , \+ while \] it was , uh , talking about it , E_S ###and then I , N_S ###it *EXP*-1 took so long for someone to answer , E_S ###I started *-1 reading the newspaper , and kind of forgot about it . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###SpeakerB6 . ###SpeakerA7 . ###But , uh , yeah , E_S 
38835:4	###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###I live in a pretty small apartment , E_S ###and , uh , I would have *-1 to , you know , put stuff away .

39035:6	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###I guess 0 if I had a house I might enjoy gardening , some . E_S ###I 'm not real crazy about *-1 pulling weeds and things like that . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's the hard work . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I like the planting , 
39127:92	###SpeakerA103 . ###They did n't like it too much . E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###SpeakerA105 . ###Yeah , E_S ###oh yeah E_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###Oh , that 's good , E_S ###SpeakerA107 . ###right in the tub , E_S 
39160:8	###and we thought , well maybe when they 're a little bit bigger *T*-1 then we 'll , N_S ###SpeakerA117 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB118 . ###or * get into a house with a little more space .

39283:15	###\[ They , \+ they , \] N_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###They have a T I plant in Texas , in Kingsport ? E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah , E_S ###we have , N_S ###it 's in Johnson City . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Oh , uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB24 .

E_S ###SpeakerB17 . 
41620:20	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###What about the mini skirt ? E_S ###SpeakerB31 . ###There are a few people *ICH*-2 every now and then that *T*-1 wear those to work .

48241:21	###SpeakerB8 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Uh , it 's , N_S ###there 's was a mandatory jail sentence if you were caught *-1 , um , with a firearm E_S ###and also I think 0 there was a fine . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###And that did n't help at all ? E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###No , E_S ###I do n't , N_S

50608:50	###SpeakerA193 . ###now you watch , E_S ###just sure as anything , the Japanese are going *-1 to come out with a laptop at half the price with more stuff on it . E_S ###SpeakerB194 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA195 . ###SpeakerB196 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ the , \+ the , \] N_S 
50805:69	###Now I had a lot of friends who *T*-1 went to the Peace Corps , uh , back in the mid sixties E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Uh-huh .

50948:77	###SpeakerA13 . ###And they 're able *-1 to do that through all the manipulations of the computer . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Well , \[ that , \+ that 's \] not really good .

50999:17	###Is there anybody who *T*-1 does n't ? E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Well , there are a few out there . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Um .

51035:63	###SpeakerA47 . ###I mean it 's not really government for the people and by the people , E_S ###I 'll tell you that . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###So , N_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Hum , what do you think 0 *T*-1 could be done *-2 about it ? E_S ###SpeakerA51 . 
51041:45	###So , N_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Hum , what do you think 0 *T*-1 could be done *-2 about it ?

E_S ###It 's just like we need *-1 to get rid *-2 of these clowns that *T*-3 's serving in the office . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###SpeakerA53 . ###The only thing really that *T*-1 can be changed *-2 is for \[ us to , \+ everybody to \] say , we 've had enough of you , ###out you go *T*-3 . E_S 
51062:10	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###SpeakerB58 . ###It really is *?* . E_S ###It 's N_S ###\[ something that , \+ something that \] I 've just had \[ a , \+ a \] dealing with *T*-1 is like a credit bureau . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Uh-huh .

51179:29	###Yeah , E_S ###coliseum , Wally Moon and all that . E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###Okay , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###it 's a , um , N_S ###\[ I , \+ I 'm \] living \[ in , \+ \] just west of Baltimore , ###and Frederick , um , which *T*-1 is also just west of Baltimore , has a minor league team . E_S 
51270:50	###But that does n't mean * get three other guys who *T*-1 hit , ###all 0 they can do *T*-2 is *-3 hit home runs and strike out you know , which they did *T*-4 . E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###SpeakerB39 . ###Yep . E_S ###SpeakerA40 . ###So . N_S ###SpeakerB41 . 
51690:21	###SpeakerB114 . ###He goes to a really crummy day school . E_S ###My sister 's not real bright , E_S ###\[ so , \+ but \] \[ he , \+ he 's \] always sick .

51752:22	###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA141 . ###SpeakerB142 . ###That 's right . E_S ###I think 0 that 's an ideal situation . E_S ###SpeakerA143 . ###Because you do n't know , uh , N_S ###because like at her school , um , as soon as you drive up it 's got like a circular type drive . E_S ###They sit E_S ###and they have car callers E_S 
51783:22	###and a lot of parents have places 0 * to go *T*-1 \[ and \+ and \] things like that . E_S ###SpeakerB154 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA155 . ###And it 's late at night , E_S ###so , you know , now it does n't bother me at all E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerB156 . ###Is that where the , N_S ###over there off of , like , N_S 
52213:18	###SpeakerA66 . ###And , * just \[ kind of , \+ kind of \] go out and , uh , rent all the movies and , uh , uh , you know , just kind of go , N_S ###I guess 0 you could do that , you know , get all of David Carradine 's movies , or , uh , uh , Segal , E_S ###SpeakerB67 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA68 . ###to , N_S ###what *T*-1 's his first name . E_S ###I ca n't remember his first name . E_S ###SpeakerB69 . 
52462:6	###and yes , E_S I would suggest * seeing it at the theater . E_S ###I know that they 're still playing it E_S ###and they pushed it back , to *-1 playing it in the theaters until like August , E_S ###SpeakerA148 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB149 . ###I , think because \[ they were , \+ they were \] scheduling a video release of it in July E_S ###and then when it won all those awards *T*-1 , uh , they pushed it back to August , E_S ###so . ###But , yeah , E_S 
52504:42	###SpeakerA9 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###SpeakerA11 . ###SpeakerB12 . ###So , it *EXP*-1 really bothers me that there 's not a way of * getting him out of the way forever . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Really , E_S ###I think that , N_S ###I do n't know , E_S 
52510:94	###SpeakerA13 . ###Really , E_S ###I think that , N_S ###I do n't know , E_S ###\[ I don- , \+ I do n't \] think 0 our prison system is n't set *-1 up , where we , um , rehabilitate , or , you know , restore anybody *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###SpeakerA15 . ###I think 0 it 'll only make them worse , E_S ###but , \[ I , \+ I \] believe that God can come in and change a person 's heart and genuinely change it , E_S ###but , that does n't negate that you do reap what you sow *T*-1 . E_S 
52511:66	###Really , E_S ###I think that , N_S ###I do n't know , E_S ###\[ I don- , \+ I do n't \] think 0 our prison system is n't set *-1 up , where we , um , rehabilitate , or , you know , restore anybody *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###SpeakerA15 . ###I think 0 it 'll only make them worse , E_S ###but , \[ I , \+ I \] believe that God can come in and change a person 's heart and genuinely change it , E_S ###but , that does n't negate that you do reap what you sow *T*-1 . E_S ###And if you do kill a person and \[ it is , \+ \] you know , you 're found *-1 to be guilty , I believe 0 *T*-2 God establishes the authority of our court system E_S 
52549:10	###It is obvious . E_S ###And they know that . E_S ###\[ They 're , \+ they 're \] not going *-1 to pardon someone from the governor , E_S ###you know what I 'm saying *T*-1 , E_S ###they 're not going *-1 to go , without *-2 going through every channel of authority in the prison . E_S ###So I feel like you know , \[ that 's is , \+ there is \] occasions where \[ there are , \+ they do \] spare lives *T*-1 E_S ###and , you know , I leave that with the governor , who , *T*-1 of course , is going *-2 to go through every authority because they want *-3 to be be reelected *-4 , E_S ###so N_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yes E_S 
52611:28	###Because under the law if your child \[ mo- , \+ \] back talks you , he would be stoned *-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . ###SpeakerB46 . ###That 's correct . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###\[ He , \+ under the law he \] would be stoned *-1 , E_S ###so we 've been removed *-1 \[ from the law , of un- , \+ from *-2 being under the law \] E_S ###but \[ we 're still , \+ you know , we 're still \] accountable to it . E_S ###We do n't need *-1 to back talk , E_S 
52618:88	###so we 've been removed *-1 \[ from the law , of un- , \+ from *-2 being under the law \] E_S ###but \[ we 're still , \+ you know , we 're still \] accountable to it . E_S ###We do n't need *-1 to back talk , E_S ###but , you know , it 's like God changes your heart * to not do that . E_S ###He changes your heart * not to look upon a woman in lust . E_S ###Because in the Old Testament , they could look all 0 they wanted *T*-1 , just could n't do it . E_S ###But in the new , he 's looking at your heart E_S ###and so , I guess 0 that 's \[ what , \+ what \] I mean *T*-1 by their character changes ###and , you know , what I mean *T*-2 , it 's like * looking beyond what they 're doing *T*-3 and looking at a heart and seeing what is the heart *T*-1 , what 's the character showing me *T*-4 here . E_S ###\[ And , those , \+ and then any \] of , N_S 
52633:27	###SpeakerB50 . ###I tend *-1 to agree on that , very strongly . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###And that 's where we just have *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] trust the authorities *T*-2 . E_S ###And they 're not going *-1 to excuse people , if it \[ was , \+ was \] run *-2 like that , E_S ###I do n't , N_S ###there would probably be very few exceptions to that E_S ###and if it was done *-1 quickly and done *-1 swiftly N_S ###\[ and , \+ but \] it 's not , because the judicial system \[ has rejected , \+ they 've rejected \] the answer to all these problems 0 they have *T*-1 , pretty much . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . 
52655:90	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Because we 're suit happy . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###\[ But , \+ but \] back \[ to the , \+ to the \] capital situation , * sounds like you and I have a lot \[ \[ of , \+ of , \] \+ of , \] uh , common ground at least \[ as , \+ as \] far \[ as , \+ as \] capital punishment is concerned *-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . 
52707:30	###I forget what you call it *T*-1 , E_S ###but anyway , and \[ everyone , \+ they \] had like fifteen people lined *-1 up on the fence E_S ###and within two hours , there were fifteen boys sitting there doing the same thing .

53070:8	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA119 . ###SpeakerB120 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###But I would love *-1 to camp , in the mountains . E_S ###SpeakerB122 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA123 . ###SpeakerB124 . 
53072:17	###SpeakerB120 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###But I would love *-1 to camp , in the mountains . E_S ###SpeakerB122 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA123 . ###SpeakerB124 . ###Estes State Park is fantastic . E_S ###SpeakerA125 . 
53163:4	###I have n't *?* . E_S ###\[ I 'm , \+ um , I 'm \] a struggling single mom . E_S ###SpeakerA159 . ###Oh , gosh , * bless your heart . E_S ###SpeakerB160 . ###and , uh , N_S ###* thank you . E_S ###SpeakerA161 . ###SpeakerB162 . ###Um , it 's , you know , N_S 
53737:85	###SpeakerA15 . ###Yeah . E_S ###That 's , N_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###But why * not hit the points 0 the kid 's really interested in *T*-1 *T*-2 ? E_S ###Because if he 's interested , he 's going *-1 to study it , E_S ###and he 's going *-1 to learn it , E_S ###and he 's going *-1 to remember it . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###That 's true . E_S 
53765:30	###I definitely agree . E_S ###There 's no doubt about that . E_S ###\[ \[ \[ I , \+ uh , I , \] \+ I mean , \] \+ I \] can relate to that because \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] going to college right now , E_S ###and I feel like , I mean , ###I 'm taking this history class . E_S ###And , I mean , it 's so boring , E_S ###and I just hate it . E_S ###And I think , why do they make us take this stuff *T*-1 ? E_S ###I mean , what does this have *-1 to do *T*-2 with * getting , you know , a computer science degree or whatever , you know ? E_S ###SpeakerB24 . 
53821:20	###but I 'm from the Dallas area . E_S ###And they were talking about the Plano school system , that , they had one school that , uh , if the students did something wrong , I mean , whether it was behavioral or , uh , you know , they were n't learning properly or something . They took these students and put them basically in a closet . With no windows *T*-1 . E_S ###They had , \[ a , \+ a \] table , or not a table , but a desk in this closet , E_S ###and they had *-1 to sit in there by themselves . E_S ###Well , parents were getting really angry about this , because they said , Why is my child being put *-1 in this closet *T*-2 . E_S ###Well , how is that helping my child , you know *T*-1 . E_S ###And , uh , \[ the , \+ the \] thing , you know , N_S ###they said , Well , we 're giving them isolation time E_S ###and this helps them to think . E_S ###But a lot of kids , N_S 
53837:23	###That 's true . E_S ###But , no , E_S ###I mean , they were , uh , I mean , N_S ###I definitely agree with parents . E_S ###I think 0 that is a very wrong way 0 * to handle , uh , *-1 disciplining a child *T*-2 . E_S ###* Putting them in , I mean , \[ \[ they were , \+ they were call- , \] \+ they called \] them *ICH*-1 their quiet rooms or their isolation rooms . E_S ###They did n't call them closets .

53936:23	###SpeakerA63 . ###But I do n't know . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###I mean , there 's a point of over kill , E_S ###but somewhere \[ in , \+ \] you 've got *-1 to find an even line . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###Well , there 's so many parents that *T*-1 say , 0 you can deal with a child without *-2 spanking them . Which *T*-3 is true , ###you can *?* . E_S

E_S ###But there are times when a child needs *-1 to be spanked *-2 *T*-3 . E_S ###I mean , they do things that they need that . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###* Need that shock effect , where they equate the shock of *-2 being spanked *-1 with the actions 0 they did *T*-3 to get spanked *-4 *T*-5 . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Right .

54212:17	###And here , you know , \[ all , \+ all \] my black friends are professionals E_S ###and \[ \[ they 're , \+ they do n't , \] \+ you know , they do n't \] go out and abuse drugs E_S ###and \[ they , \+ they \] send their kids to school E_S ###and \[ \[ they , \+ they , \] \+ they \] uh , you know really encourage them to go to college and stuff .

E_S ###SpeakerB51 . ###Yeah , E_S ###exactly , E_S 
54330:18	###and right , E_S ###what they were going *-1 to say *T*-2 . E_S ###And the American people , when this first started *T*-1 , they were even reluctant *-2 to let them do that . E_S ###SpeakerA60 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB61 . ###So \[ they were , \+ they were \] playing it * very safe , E_S ###but , you know , it , ###\[ an ounce \+ ###what do they say *T*-1 ,

54718:47	###I mean , I think 0 Roseanne Arquett *ICH*-2 was in it too , another one that if you blink you 'd miss *T*-1 her .

55024:4	###SpeakerA15 . ###I guess 0 you keep those things 0 you grew up with *T*-1 . E_S ###I worked in , uh , Missouri for a while E_S ###and , uh , I was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on T V *T*-1 when the Cowboys were playing the Saint Louis Cardinals *T*-2 E_S ###and I was rooting for the Cowboys .

55096:12	###SpeakerB36 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] tell you , ###it 's difficult in that guy 's position * coming into that because there , he was just so highly touted *-1 by the press and everybody expected so many big things , you know .

55165:9	###no . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###But that was just a good football game . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###And it 's funny , E_S you know . ###You like *-1 to pull for the underdog E_S ###and for a long time I was pulling for Denver . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . 
55278:6	###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###I 'm surprised 0 during this Iraqi crisis we did n't have more incidents than they did . E_S ###These guys are top of the line .

55318:26	###You put five Soviet hyundee helicopters in the air , they can level the entire area E_S ###and there wo n't be anything left * alive . E_S ###And they can do that in about four minutes .

55483:82	###Yeah . E_S ###It 's totally women . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###See , I think 0 that 's what *T*-1 's my biggest problem with * going to \[ a place , \+ uh , \[ a , \+ a \] health club . \] E_S ###Because I do n't feel like *-1 having a bunch of other people watch me exercise .

55803:24	###SpeakerA141 . ###but I got talked *-1 into the bike instead . E_S ###And I do n't know , E_S ###I really wanted a stepper .

55813:42	###Uh , the one nice thing about the bicycle is 0 you just sit .

55855:28	###SpeakerB2 . ###Right . E_S ###Uh , who *T*-1 wants *-2 to start this one ?

55956:96	###SpeakerA35 . ###and also , you know , \[ you , \+ you \] feel more like , you know , you 're actually part of the community if you 've done something , in it .

56110:26	###and even if it 's not environmentally safe , who *T*-1 cares , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###I 'm sure 0 the pendulum will swing the other way .

E_S ###SpeakerA107 . ###Yeah , E_S 
57106:34	###Yeah , E_S ###well their job is * to be reelected *-1 , by in large , E_S ###and , so they work on that job .

57112:6	###that kind of thing . E_S ###SpeakerB108 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###And , there 's a notion that somehow , if someone is n't as much as a government person , they 're less corrupt and they 're more likely *-1 to be good which *T*-2 is really strange , E_S ###because , I mean , if I 'm hiring a plumber , I want a real plumber , E_S ###I want someone trained * in , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , uh , E_S ###I was just trying *-1 to think about \[ how I , \+ how I \] dress for work *T*-2 , you know , E_S 
57125:17	###SpeakerA3 . ###And , uh , what I usually do *T*-1 on the weekend \[ is , \+ is \] * lay out five outfits E_S ###and , uh , on Monday \[ I , \+ I \] wear \[ the , \+ the \] worst looking one .

E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###And then progressively through the week , \[ I 'll , \+ I 'll \] wear nicer looking things E_S 
57151:4	###Um , I work in the computer lab at school E_S ###so I can just wear whatever I have *T*-1 on for school , E_S ###\[ \[ an , \+ and , \] \+ um , and \] really it 's , N_S ###I try *-1 to \[ dre- , \+ dress \] *-2 presentable but very comfortable . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Like , um , in the warm weather it 's always shorts and a t-shirt or a button up or something like that E_S ###and then in the winter time it 's jeans \[ or , \+ or \] pants . E_S ###I usually , uh , you know , N_S 
57222:11	###SpeakerA37 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###and he 'll be over there until July first *-1 setting up some kind of computers for them . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###I see . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###\[ Over in T , \+ I mean for T I \] but over in Italy . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah , E_S

57454:8	###yeah , E_S ###um , they do n't really buy the first quality , E_S ###they buy the second . E_S ###And , uh , places like J C Penney 's \[ that \+ \] they 'll reject the seconds , E_S ###they 'll send them back every time . E_S ###SpeakerB122 . ###Uh-huh .

57580:73	###I do n't think 0 I 'd know where * to start *T*-1 with a diesel .

57609:21	###I 've had a lot of good service out of that car , E_S ###but , uh , uh , I finally gave it to my son E_S ###and he drove it literally into the ground , you know .

58240:6	###well I 've lived both in the United States \[ and , \+ and \] in a country where they do use the metric system *T*-1 E_S ###\[ and , \+ uh , so \] \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] lived with MUMBLEx pounds and inches and found it *EXP*-1 really quite easy * to convert over .

E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###SpeakerB16 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###and , I think 0 that 's what *T*-1 hung people up the most is 0 they went now * wait a minute , 
58248:8	###SpeakerA17 . ###and , I think 0 that 's what *T*-1 hung people up the most is 0 they went now * wait a minute , ###an inch is two point fifty-four centimeters , E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###how on earth am I every going *-1 to do the math *T*-2 ? E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . 
58248:100	###SpeakerA17 . ###and , I think 0 that 's what *T*-1 hung people up the most is 0 they went now * wait a minute , ###an inch is two point fifty-four centimeters , E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###how on earth am I every going *-1 to do the math *T*-2 ? E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . 
58249:25	###and , I think 0 that 's what *T*-1 hung people up the most is 0 they went now * wait a minute , ###an inch is two point fifty-four centimeters , E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###how on earth am I every going *-1 to do the math *T*-2 ? E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###And the problem is that we tried *-1 to convert everything from inches to centimeters * preserving basically the inches but expressing them as centimeters rather than * saying no , a centimeter is about the width of your thumbnail , or whatever , \[ and , \+ you know , and \] leaving it at that E_S 
58295:18	###\[ that 's , \+ that 's \] probably true E_S ###and America does have a long history of * sort of doing things our own way rather than adopting , you know , some other model .

E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###I 've never heard that one , E_S ###that 's very nice . E_S ###Oh , so I 'm all for the metric system and * converting over E_S ###and I think , N_S 
58362:20	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###\[ and , \+ you know . But \] that must have been tremendously difficult 0 * to orchestrate *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###SpeakerB54 . ###I 'm sure . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Um , so \[ \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I , \] \+ I , \] \+ I \] think 0 it *EXP*-1 's essential that it 's done E_S 
58387:165	###Uh-huh , E_S ###I saw that , E_S ###I saw that the other day . E_S ###I \[ don- , \+ do n't \] drink soda pop , E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###but I saw a two liter soda pop bottle E_S ###so , yeah , E_S ###things like that are a good start E_S 
58451:6	###SpeakerA14 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###but that 's neat though , because you get *-1 to have different stuff . E_S ###SpeakerB15 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I 'm not , \+ I 'm \] a pretty bad cook . E_S ###I 'm pretty bad . E_S

58705:13	###SpeakerA98 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###That 's true . E_S ###SpeakerB99 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I like , \+ I like \] them every now and then for a change , E_S ###\[ ye- , \+ \] it 's nice . E_S ###SpeakerA100 . ###Yeah , E_S

58921:20	###\[ one of my , \+ one of my \] friends here , he was just talking how he 's thinking of *-1 leaving the company and going to Dallas *T*-2 , E_S ###* saying how , N_S ###SpeakerA164 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###no kidding .

58972:102	###SpeakerA7 . ###I mean , they may let you off for a day or two *-1 to have your baby , E_S ###but that will be it , E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###or either they 'll have a computer at home *RNR*-2 and in the hospital *RNR*-2 where you \[ can just , \+ you know , just \] continue right on with your work *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###\[ Ye- , \+ yeah . \] E_S ###SpeakerA11 . 
58979:95	###SpeakerB10 . ###\[ Ye- , \+ yeah . \] E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###I mean , \[ i- , \+ it \] really is coming to that because most women now days can not afford the time that they could take *T*-1 off unless the company pays them .

59001:20	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###SpeakerB22 . ###Oh , that is good . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###I mean I did n't work , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] needed *-1 to E_S ###but I did n't . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah , E_S 
59073:8	###SpeakerB44 . ###Oh , I know , E_S ###I know . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###and they 're getting worse . E_S ###Uh , my daughter brought home a book *ICH*-4 the other day that she was going *-1 to have *-2 to have *T*-3 for \[ her , \+ one of her \] next classes E_S ###and it was like ninety-six dollars . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Gee . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . 
59129:61	###Well you know , I ca n't imagine how I did *T*-1 , because now I work all the time , E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###and , um , well I work all week , E_S ###and , um , I ca n't imagine how I stayed home *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###You know , I think to myself , what did I do *T*-1 . E_S 
59131:10	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###and , um , well I work all week , E_S ###and , um , I ca n't imagine how I stayed home *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###You know , I think to myself , what did I do *T*-1 . E_S ###And I think \[ it just , \+ it revolutionized \] \[ an , \+ where \] a woman thinks that a way *T*-1 , you know , just like , N_S ###now my daughter , there 's no way that she can imagine herself married at the age that she 's at *T*-1 now *T*-2 . E_S 
59180:16	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###It 's real small town , E_S ###and i- , N_S ###and a lot of people in our su- , N_S ###we 're the only couple *ICH*-3 in our Sunday School class , except for one other couple , who *T*-1 are in their forties , E_S and they ca n't have children , \[ who \+ \] *T*-2 do n't have children . E_S ###And they ca n't imagine why we would want *-1 to have children *T*-2 . E_S ###And , I 'm going well , you know , \[ there 's more to life , \+ you know , there 's life \] in there that *T*-1 's , N_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###SpeakerB84 . 
59222:20	###But I was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that *T*-1 married during my time , they had kids within a year . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###And I just was not ready for kids . E_S ###I wanted *-1 to get out and work a little bit E_S ###and I wanted *-1 to travel and stuff like that , which we did *T*-2 . E_S ###And , uh , kids did n't fit in right then , E_S ###but , it 's getting more and more like that where there 's more and more couples *T*-1 E_S ###and , really , if you do n't want the kids , then it 's not the time 0 * to have , N_S 
59263:8	###And , I guess 0 I just N_S ###and I saw how life was *T*-2 when she stayed home *T*-1 E_S ###and it was rough , E_S ###it was hard , E_S ###and , uh . N_S ###SpeakerA107 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and it really is *?* , E_S ###I know , E_S ###just like now , you know , \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] so much more now . E_S 
59326:30	###But the reason 0 they had *-2 to do this *T*-1 was because \[ so many people , \+ you know , so many women \] could not afford , N_S ###like you said if you had four kids , or even if you had two kids , you would be paying all your salary *-1 to pay for those two kids to go . E_S ###SpeakerB128 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA129 . ###So , uh , more and more of our hospitals , especially , over here are getting them E_S ###and then some of the bigger companies , N_S ###but it 's mainly the hospitals . E_S ###SpeakerB130 . ###Yeah , E_S 
59368:14	###SpeakerA9 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###\[ I resp- , \+ I respect \] them and what their capabilities are *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
59470:29	###Uh-huh .

62144:8	###SpeakerA67 . ###Right , E_S ###you know , \[ they , \+ they 'd \] figure a way around that one in a heartbeat .

62178:41	###SpeakerB76 . ###Right , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Um , and one of the quick examples is the Aborigines . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Yeah , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Uh , when we were in Australia *T*-1 , , uh , N_S 
62193:40	###And they 're just kind of more like a side show than anything else E_S ###and that 's sad . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . 
62323:4	###SpeakerB12 . ###SpeakerA13 . ###I- , N_S ###* let me tell you just a little bit about myself . E_S ###\[ I , \+ for years I \] did all that shopping and whatnot , E_S ###but for the last four or five years I 've had eye problem , E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###and I 've had two cornea transplants . E_S 
62415:8	###but we tried *-1 to figure out whether we could put three in because we really need *-2 to be able *-3 to put at least three in . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###And , N_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Oh , no , E_S ###the computer was supposed *-1 to have two . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Well , it has them E_S 
62447:6	###SpeakerB54 . ###Okay . E_S ###So they did that . E_S ###And we said are you sure 0 this will work , E_S ###we do n't want you to go through the work and then find out that this does n't really work anyway , and et cetera , E_S ###and \[ they 're , \+ they were \] doing it at their own costs . E_S ###\[ And \+ so \] we said , fine . E_S ###And we went back E_S ###and we talked to the MUMBLEx person a second time and things like that , E_S ###and then \[ we come , \+ we get \] the computer home , E_S 
62477:25	###and they say 0 they can , you know , do something different and change some connectors E_S ###and we hope so , E_S ###but it 's a hassle . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it really is *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###\[ You kn- , \+ you know , \] 0 it 's just this problem with sales people just not knowing what *T*-1 goes on . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Right , E_S 
62563:36	###and the next thing 0 I knew *T*-1 the tape was chewed *-2 up in the , thing . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###Oh , no . E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###Okay , E_S ###so after that then \[ you could n't get a \+ , you could n't get a \] tape 0 * to play *T*-1 at the right speed in that side . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###And then on the other side , \[ when I , \+ when \[ I , uh , \+ I \[ loa- , \+ loaned \] \] \] it to my daughter the other day * to take it over \[ to , \+ uh , to , \] uh , videotaping 0 they were doing *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S 
62570:6	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###And then on the other side , \[ when I , \+ when \[ I , uh , \+ I \[ loa- , \+ loaned \] \] \] it to my daughter the other day * to take it over \[ to , \+ uh , to , \] uh , videotaping 0 they were doing *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S ###and she says 0 it 's wrong too because the little thing pokes out too far , E_S ###and so \[ you ca n't , \+ you ca n't \] get it to run \[ the right , \+ the right \] way , either , E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###so , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB104 . 
62684:28	###SpeakerB144 . ###SpeakerA145 . ###so , part of it is that we need *-1 to develop more \[ of a , \+ of a \] pride \[ in , \+ in , \] uh , the kinds of things 0 we do *T*-2 so we make them better . E_S ###SpeakerB146 . ###Good . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA147 . ###And it kind of has *-1 to start from the top \[ \[ and , \+ and go clea- , \] \+ or from the bottom maybe and go clear \] up . E_S ###People , N_S ###SpeakerB148 . 
62693:6	###SpeakerB148 . ###Well , I think 0 part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship . E_S ###The people just do n't care about , what they 're doing *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA149 . ###No . E_S ###SpeakerB150 . ###SpeakerA151 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB152 . ###You know , the whole , N_S 
62755:52	###SpeakerB174 . ###And so , N_S ###SpeakerA175 . ###\[ It probab- , \+ it probably \] basically goes right back into the \[ h- , \+ home \] though unfortunately .

E_S ###SpeakerB176 . ###Little value just in whatever you do *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA177 . ###Yeah . E_S 
62883:8	###SpeakerA37 . ###SpeakerB38 . ###Then I went back again a couple times and missed another time , and then kept *-1 missing and never went back again . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###I think , 0 if you , N_S you just have *-1 to stick with it . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###I think 0 I 've been *?* two maybe three times the month of April , E_S 
62912:18	###SpeakerA49 . ###I could have gone tonight , E_S ###and I did n't . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###So , I 'm kind of finding excuses , E_S ###and now it 's kind of like , well , N_S this is the last week . E_S ###I 'll just start fresh next week . E_S ###But , I \[ better \+ , better \] *-1 do it . E_S 
62926:14	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###So . N_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Sure , E_S ###yeah E_S ###that makes a difference when you have somebody 0 * to go with *T*-1 and 0 *T*-2 to do the same the same thing *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . 
62981:4	###in fact , I do n't run . E_S ###I hate *-1 to run . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Like when I walk *T*-1 I 'll take along a radio or something E_S ###and that helps , you know , * pass the time . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Right . E_S ###Yeah , E_S 
62996:8	###SpeakerB72 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###And it 's not as boring if you get several people E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###and you can kind of talk , E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] \[ it , \+ it \] makes it pass pretty quickly , E_S 
63038:8	###and I just feel much better . E_S ###I mean , I 've been kind of dragging the last few weeks , E_S ###and I know 0 if I would just get around to exercising I 'd feel better .

63051:20	###SpeakerA89 . ###Well , I 'm too tired , E_S ###or I have a headache E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###SpeakerA91 . ###well , I just got over the flu , E_S ###and I 'm still kind of draggy E_S ###so I better *-1 not go . E_S ###SpeakerB92 . 
63063:71	###Yeah , E_S ###it really is *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I find , too , that I have more energy when I exercise *T*-1 , E_S ###and , you know , it *EXP*-1 's silly * not to *?* , E_S ###but , I do n't know , E_S ###it 's just a put off . E_S ###I do n't know why I do n't do more *T*-1 , E_S ###\[ and I , \+ and I \] know that it 's good for my health . E_S 
63176:53	###SpeakerB130 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA131 . ###But there 's a lot more guys that *T*-1 do that one . E_S ###SpeakerB132 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA133 . ###And , um , they have them , you know , in the evenings , E_S ###they even have some late night ones for people that *T*-1 work second shift and things like that . E_S ###So they have big variety . E_S 
63331:9	###SpeakerA29 . ###\[ The , \+ uh , I think 0 maybe there 's where the \] problem came in *T*-1 , you know . E_S ###We 've tried *-1 to , instead of *-2 learning , E_S ###it 's kind of like * learning a language , you know , E_S ###when you learn one from the other *T*-1 , you always end up in this conversion thing all the time . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###So , you , N_S ###it 's almost like , uh , N_S 
63337:9	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###So , you , N_S ###it 's almost like , uh , N_S ###course this country is n't a dictatorship , E_S ###but , you know , it 's like somebody said , okay as of such and such a date , you know , anybody caught * talking in the English , you know , will be shot *-1 or something like that , you know .

63428:6	###You know , I guess 0 that 's some N_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###About half a liter . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###it 's not a liter , E_S ###it 's like a half a liter or something like that .

63445:31	###SpeakerB72 . ###SpeakerA73 . ###Well , I had kind of gotten used to centigrade temperature , you know , E_S ###if it 's between zero and ten , it 's cold , E_S ###and if it 's ten and twenty it 's not too bad , E_S ###if it 's between twenty and thirty it 's pretty warm , E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###It 's getting warm , right .

63513:18	###He just get one more MUMBLEx .

63542:13	###I thought 0 maybe they would convert to , uh , metric back when they went to the fifty-five mile an hour speed limit *T*-1 , because what is it *T*-2 fifty-six or fifty-seven 's \[ a hundred , \+ uh , \[ qua- , \+ \] a hundred \] kilometers , E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###I noticed that about things like N_S ###\[ I s- , \+ I seen \] a lot of adds *ICH*-1 recently for organic fertilizers \[ and , \+ and \] lawn additives and that type of thing , E_S ###but the cost \[ is , \+ is \] like , double or sometimes triple , \[ what \+ \] the regular \[ things 0 you , \+ fertilizers and things 0 you \] buy *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###So , in , in terms of that , N_S it 's , N_S ###you know , and , for the environment \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ there 's \] a good reason 0 * to do it *T*-1 , E_S 
63811:44	###\[ I , \+ I 'd \] heard something stranger , E_S ###* talk about bottles the other day \[ on , uh , \+ on \] the radio station , I think 0 it 's K L T Y .

E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###SpeakerB80 . ###Oh , really ? E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###And apparently \[ they , \+ they \] do n't break down very easily , E_S 
63849:10	###SpeakerB92 . ###What else , N_S ###something else was made *-1 out of old tires , E_S ###I was trying *-1 to remember what it was *T*-2 . ###Oh , I ca n't think of it now .

E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###And just anything , 0 * to , you know , recycle *T*-1 rather than keep *-2 throwing *T*-1 it away , E_S 
63858:90	###And just anything , 0 * to , you know , recycle *T*-1 rather than keep *-2 throwing *T*-1 it away , E_S ###but my biggest problem is , 0 I take the bags out of the store , buy the bags * to bring the back , E_S ###and then I forget *-1 to bring them in the store . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###I 'm forever going back out to my car *-1 to pick up my bags *-2 to bring them and take my garbage back out .

E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###Well , I think 0 \[ the , \+ the \] more 0 people are aware of it *T*-1 , \[ the , \+ the \] more they 'll do *T*-2 . E_S 
64030:9	###SpeakerB53 . ###Green . E_S ###SpeakerA54 . ###SpeakerB55 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA56 . ###Oh my goodness , it 's pretty . E_S ###SpeakerB57 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA58 .

64143:27	###SpeakerA96 . ###I was dumb . E_S ###I was in , um , Florida for a week on business . E_S ###SpeakerB97 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA98 . ###And I had called back to the house .

64165:61	###SpeakerA102 . ###* Felt so dumb . E_S ###SpeakerB103 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA104 . ###Finally I got home and found out 0 my property was okay . E_S ###SpeakerB105 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA106 . ###There was no problem with it . E_S 
64175:6	###But I guess 0 you just tend *-1 to think \[ of , \+ of \] where your house is *T*-2 you know , and nothing else . E_S ###SpeakerB107 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA108 . ###SpeakerB109 . ###Right , E_S ###and close to that , what *T*-1 's called *-2 Duck Creek that *T*-3 runs through part of Garland , that 's the part that *T*-4 always seems *-5 to get hardest hit *-6 when \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] the hard rain *T*-7 .

64632:4	###SpeakerB70 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###But when I went more rural *T*-1 , you know , \[ that , \+ it \] really changed . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###So , N_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Yeah . E_S 
64689:34	###SpeakerA91 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###SpeakerA93 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###And , um , now you can even get books on tape , um . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S 
64729:34	###\[ that 's , \+ that \] would be good . E_S ###SpeakerB108 . ###Yep . E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###Well , we strayed a lot from music . E_S ###SpeakerB110 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I guess so . E_S ###Well , N_S ###SpeakerA111 . 
65105:69	###SpeakerB12 . ###\[ And , \+ and , \] of course , * being a woman , I like romance novels and stuff like that a whole lot .

65152:13	###It 's , i- , N_S ###some of those books are real tough 0 * to get into *T*-1 , E_S ###but after you get into them , they 're really good . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Yeah .

65282:8	###I mean , \[ th- , \+ that 's \] why I like *-1 to read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED * so much *T*-2 E_S ###because there 's everything in it . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I \[ had a , \+ uh , had a \] subscription to that last year , E_S ###but \[ I 'm , \+ uh , I 'm \] mostly a baseball fan .

65532:16	###they would have collapsed . E_S ###So I 'm kind of glad 0 they 're staying there .

65755:13	###I mean \[ they , \+ they 're \] trying *-1 to get more people into that field . E_S ###But they ca n't just bring somebody in without *-1 even having gone to , you know , school in that area before they can work , you know , for a lawyer as a paralegal . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###* Excuse me . I see it being done *-1 . E_S ###I know of a friend that *T*-1 works for my lawyer that *T*-2 has had no training whatsoever E_S ###and she 's training her . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Well , yeah , E_S ###\[ \[ \[ I , \+ I 'm , \] \+ well ya- , I , \] \+ you know , I 'm \] assuming that it can be done *-1 . 
65997:42	###I mean , \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-2 's \] tempting when you see something *T*-1 * to say , `` Well , I 'll just charge it .

E_S ###SpeakerA52 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB53 . ###SpeakerA54 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB55 . 
66082:57	###That 's scary . E_S ###SpeakerA84 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Because \[ every , \+ every \] month all of these credit cards report to the credit bureau , you know .

66131:16	###\[ or \+ and \] you , by that day N_S ###and you 're \[ thir- , \+ ###thirty \] days is not real bad though anyway . ###If you 've got a charge off on your credit report or something like that .

66308:14	###Uh , I ca n't remember . E_S ###* Refresh my memory . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###\[ It was , \+ uh , that was \] the one that *T*-1 was used *-2 so much in the campaign . \[ In the politica- , \+ in the presidential \] race .

E_S ###SpeakerB30 . 
66332:45	###Yeah . E_S ###Well I think 0 in large measure the reason 0 they do n't care *T*-1 , N_S ###it 's not because the punishment , N_S ###but so many of the people that *T*-1 commit crimes do n't get punished *-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###The police do n't catch them , E_S ###or the courts do n't convict them , E_S ###\[ or , \+ or \] they do n't serve very much of the time E_S 
66345:23	###SpeakerA39 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###and \[ there 's , \+ uh , there 's \] a lot of people here in Baltimore that , uh , *T*-1 have N_S ###and we just had , uh , a real big cocaine bust , E_S ###and of course , you know , \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] playing it up *-1 real big that it \[ was , \+ \] looked like it was a very , very small ring E_S ###and they just happened *-1 to get lucky and catch the guy . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . 
66363:8	###SpeakerB44 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###and , uh , once you kill off a few of them , N_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Yeah , E_S 
66367:42	###SpeakerB46 . ###Yeah .

66555:16	###SpeakerB104 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###but , um , some of these people are just out and out brutal .

66724:24	###I just , N_S ###my body \[ \[ was , \+ was , \] \+ was \] uh , tuned *-1 into \[ that , \+ that \] mode , E_S ###and \[ if I , \+ if I \] skipped it then it kind of threw \[ \[ the , \+ the \] whole , \+ the whole \] system out of whack . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Right E_S ###boy , E_S 
66773:19	###it is *?* . E_S ###Uh , \[ we 're on , \+ we 're on \] a little street called * Bison Trail .

E_S ###We , N_S ###I tell you what , E_S ###we got into the fitness center at Methodist E_S ###and they have a quarter mile track there .

E_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###Yeah , E_S ###uh , what do you ride *T*-1 , uh , ###like , a bunch of hills or pretty flat ? E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###\[ \[ It , \+ it , \] \+ it \] varies . E_S

67287:11	###So you , uh , change up your routes a lot , and keep a ... N_S ###SpeakerB115 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###I try *-1 to go someplace pretty different , you know , every week .

69439:34	###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah , E_S ###pretty much . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###So all ages . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah E_S ###and , uh , you know , there 's some my age E_S ###and then there are some a lot younger , \[ an , \+ \] about four generations , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA25 .

69812:19	###SpeakerB60 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###The biggest problem \[ with , \+ with \] the weather and the rain in this area is the soil . E_S ###It 's that black clay soil . E_S ###SpeakerB64 .

69829:6	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###You know , once it rains a little bit , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] filled *-1 up ###and everything else just runs off , E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###you know . N_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Yeah . E_S 
69861:94	###SpeakerA77 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###\[ And , \+ uh , so \] they 're still talking water rationing this Summer , E_S ###so it would seem strange because in San Antonio , N_S ###we had lived out , um , west of San Antonio , in Castroville , E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###And the water in Medina Lake and that area was really going down , that they were considering that they might have *-1 to do water rationing E_S 
69954:21	###and it just seemed like every year it just got \[ more and more humid , \+ more and more humid . \] ###And here \[ it 's , \+ uh , well it 's \] right by the ocean , E_S ###SpeakerA113 . ###Uh-huh .

69961:46	###SpeakerA115 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB116 . ###But here , um , well the water is extremely cold , up here , E_S ###you can lay on the beach all 0 you want *?* *T*-1 , E_S ###but if you want *-1 to go *-3 wind suffering or diving or swimming , you have *-2 to wear a wet suit .

69977:8	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB120 . ###It 's just completely different E_S ###and it 's much nicer . E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Probably the Pacific breezes make a lot of difference , E_S ###SpeakerB122 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###It does E_S 
69982:53	###Yeah . E_S ###Probably the Pacific breezes make a lot of difference , E_S ###SpeakerB122 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###It does E_S ###and the air does n't feel anything like it does along the gulf coast region . E_S ###But you , um , N_S ###but we like it E_S ###so it 's a nice change . E_S ###So we 'll be here a couple of years E_S 
70008:18	###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA129 . ###And , they have , of course , some pretty severe storms , Winter storms , snow and that type of thing . E_S ###SpeakerB130 . ###Uh-huh .

70030:4	###and I guess 0 I 'm going *-1 to have *-2 to try that area sometime and see what it 's like *T*-3 . E_S ###Because a lot of people that *T*-1 are from that North Carolina region really like it . E_S ###And , uh , they get the snow , E_S ###but they said 0 it does n't really get messy E_S ###and it does n't really hang around that long . E_S ###SpeakerA137 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB138 . ###So , \[ they , \+ the people \] 0 I know *T*-1 that *T*-2 are from there , uh , they always miss it E_S ###and they want *-1 to go back . E_S 
70234:13	###SpeakerA43 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . ###Okay . E_S ###Well , can you tell me anything else about the house . E_S ###Are you working on it ? E_S ###I mean , do people around that area seem *-1 to do a lot of renovation ? E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Yeah . E_S 
70254:16	###SpeakerA49 . ###and I renovated a house there E_S ###and that was so much fun . E_S ###I mean , there , if you do n't live in a house that *T*-1 's at least seventy-five to hundred years old , you know , you 're just nobody , practically . E_S ###And \[ that was really , \+ that was \] a good experience for me to learn a lot of discipline E_S ###and , uh , MUMBLEx * was considered *-1 typical for that area . E_S ###So , uh , it *EXP*-3 was quite a change for me to come to a house like that *ICH*-2 now that *T*-1 's just , you know , a very square little box E_S ###and , you know , there 's not a whole lot 0 you can do *T*-1 with it . E_S ###But , uh , anyway , N_S ###SpeakerB50 . 
70304:9	###or , you know , I usually have gotten flowers coming out the gazoo , E_S ###but \[ I , \+ I \] have n't done that , yet . E_S ###I 've had finals this week . E_S ###So , uh , you know , I 'm just kind of \[ trying * to , \+ trying *-1 to \] stick in with that , E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Huh-uh . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###but , uh , since that 's over with now , maybe \[ I can , \+ I can \] get this yard in shape . E_S ###Do you do a lot of gardening ? E_S ###SpeakerB64 . 
70337:6	###SpeakerB72 . ###Um , my favorite one is * putting on the , um , tomato plant \[ is * to put , \+ \] uh , MUMBLEx dust , E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###and that stuff has been around since the beginning of time , E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###That 's true . E_S ###That 's true . E_S 
70373:67	###SpeakerB82 . ###Not even a half bath . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###That 's rough . E_S ###The house that I used *-1 to live in *T*-2 had one bath and a half . E_S ###And that was even just with two people . E_S ###That was a pain . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . 
70407:6	###And they enjoy where they 're living *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###We 'll , N_S ###he 's nine months old . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###Oh , so he does n't know , right . E_S ###I guess , 0 he 's a big help out in your garden . E_S ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###He likes *-1 to dig around a little bit . E_S 
70665:22	###Exactly , E_S ###although so much per month anyway . N_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###And , uh , that really should be in your bu- , N_S ###but if you do n't spend it , it should be in your bank account at the end of the month . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###Yeah E_S 
70750:70	###Bye . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###I pay a good deal of taxes I guess 0 *T*-1 , because \[ I , \+ I \] make a fair amount of money , E_S ###and , uh , the taxes that I pay *T*-1 , um , I guess 0 *T*-3 \[ as a , \+ as a \] general statement , I feel \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 I get my money 's worth for *T*-2 .

E_S ###SpeakerB4 . 
70764:23	###Well , \[ I , \+ I , \] N_S ###lately , I guess , um , uh , or , at least for the last twenty years or so , I 've felt that the expenditures of our taxes into high cost , uh , defense items , at least in the last ten years , have been , uh , N_S ###there 's been and extraordinary amount of money spent * there , E_S ###and I 'm not really sure \[ that , \+ that \] we 've gotten our money 's worth there , uh , regardless of the outcome of the Desert Storm , uh , Desert Shield , uh , situations . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###SpeakerB10 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . 
70774:64	###Uh , I guess 0 my particular beef is that * having participated in the \[ mi- , \+ military \] off and on \[ over the , \+ over the \] years of *-2 being called *-1 back and things of that nature , is , uh , I 've found that , you know , there 's an extraordinary amount of waste .

E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###yeah , E_S ###and I gue- , N_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] should imagine \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ that \] \[ what the , \+ what the \] problem , N_S 
70784:74	###why \[ \[ I , \+ I 'm , \] \+ I 'm \] a little concerned about *T*-2 today is that this , uh , \[ rather , uh , quick \[ and , \+ and \] easy , \+ I do n't know , I should n't say easy , rather quick \] victory \[ in the , \+ \[ in , \+ in \] the , \] uh , Mideast , uh , uh , over the , uh , Iraqis , uh , might lead us into , uh , a false sense *ICH*-1 of security that we can do that against any other foe .

70825:43	###\[ \[ that n- , \+ that w- , \] \+ that was \] just a matter of , N_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Oh , what *T*-1 is the name of that ? E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh , it 's called *-1 Paveway . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Yes , E_S ###yes . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###And , uh , a big percentage of that was used *-1 up during that conflict also . E_S 
70874:33	###SpeakerA39 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Then we had a number of education reforms , that the legislature said , hey , we got *-1 to do this *T*-4 , ###we got *-2 to do this , ###we got *-3 to do this , E_S ###but , they forgot *-1 to put in the state budget the money 0 *T*-2 to pay for it , E_S ###and they dumped it all on the local school districts .

71065:33	###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh , so I manage *-1 to fit in my gardening chores afterward , E_S ###I work for a school system E_S ###so I 'm able *-1 to do that , um , because I get home a little earlier , E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Yes .

77186:61	###I know . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###SpeakerA85 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and what *ICH*-2 *T*-1 's sad about that is 0 day cares end up *-3 instilling values *ICH*-5 in your kids .

77544:56	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA114 . ###so \[ we , \+ we \] try *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] do it as well as we can *?* .

E_S ###SpeakerB117 . 
77826:20	###SpeakerB46 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah E_S ###I find 0 \[ I , \+ I \] read very little , E_S ###I do n't even get a regular newspaper ###and , uh , because , uh , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't drive that much , E_S ###I only live about a mile from where I go to school and work *T*-1 , E_S ###\[ I , \+ uh , I \] find 0 I spend so little time *ICH*-1 \[ in the ra- , \+ in the car \] that I do n't really listen to the radio , you know , E_S ###I do n't , E_S

78833:14	###SpeakerB144 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###yeah .

79029:11	###I think 0 it 's a marvelous idea \[ when you think of , \+ uh , when I just think of \] the papers that I dump *T*-1 out *T*-2 E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh .

79692:8	###and we always try *-1 to pay it back at the end of the month . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Huh-uh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###I have , uh , uh , . N_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###So it does n't get , uh , uh , the credit , uh , E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA7 .

E_S ###SpeakerA47 . 
79996:7	###I notice 0 \[ if you , \+ uh , if you \] stay in shape you do n't age as bad , E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###I think , too .

80414:44	###Okay , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###My husband would paint the walls and ceilings with the rollers E_S ###and I got *-1 to do all of the masking tape and then all of the little fine , uh , trim work , where I 'd use a small brush and , uh , try *-2 to keep the paint from * dripping on the windows and things like that *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###SpeakerB42 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
80569:24	###SpeakerA97 . ###Well I wish you very good luck with it E_S ###and I will tell you that I have retired from the painting business .

80641:18	###Uh-huh .

80731:10	###the San Francisco paper out there is , uh , the major paper ? E_S ###SpeakerB47 . ###Well , N_S ###SpeakerA48 . ###SpeakerB49 . ###it 's horrible . E_S ###SpeakerA50 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and that 's a terrible paper . E_S ###SpeakerB51 .

80791:63	###I read the WALL STREET JOURNAL , E_S ###not as in depth as I used *-2 to *?* , because \[ they , \+ their \] articles seem *-1 to be getting even longer and longer E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerB73 . ###Yes , E_S ###well again , I read that , uh , two columns on the front .

80998:15	###SpeakerB42 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it does . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###But that 's all 0 we get *T*-1 , E_S ###and that 's no cartoons for my little boy . E_S ###But we 've got a V C R and a lot of tapes . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . 
81133:6	###I was just thinking 0 another good one 0 I saw *T*-1 not too long ago was , um , * SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY .

81287:6	###so we could do it . E_S ###SpeakerB144 . ###That would n't be too bad . E_S ###SpeakerA145 . ###No , E_S ###and he could climb out the window . E_S ###SpeakerB146 . ###SpeakerA147 . ###Wh- , N_S ###and \[ we , \+ our whole house \] has , you know , N_S

E_S ###SpeakerB1 . ###Well Carol since today 's subject is our homes , E_S ###why do n't you tell me about yours *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###Okay , E_S ###I live in Plano , in a four bedroom , two bath house , which *T*-1 is ###the area 's dominantly three bedroom , two bath . E_S ###So , I 'm just a little bit different than typical , uh , E_S 
81476:17	###SpeakerB9 . ###* do n't need a closet . E_S ###SpeakerA10 . ###The only thing about mine , um , I think 0 there 's probably about , oh , ###when I go down the street *T*-3 I can just pick out houses \[ that *T*-1 are , \+ that *T*-2 are \] identical to mine E_S ###and usually they are the four bedroom , um , E_S ###but they 're spaced *-1 out , oh I 'd say *ICH*-2 maybe three , on a two block period . E_S ###Because it 's all different builders up here . E_S ###So it *EXP*-1 's kind of hard at that point * to , you know , classify some of the builders . E_S ###But most of the builders all built three , two . E_S 
81484:15	###So it *EXP*-1 's kind of hard at that point * to , you know , classify some of the builders . E_S ###But most of the builders all built three , two . E_S ###But the one thing , my house is a little bit different E_S ###and I can pick it out again because it 's not typical , E_S ###\[ is \+ \] I 've got the , oh , ###what do you call a , uh , double ceiling , double high in one half of the house *T*-1 . E_S ###So like the den and the living room are all double cathedral ceilings . E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###Uh , cathedral ceilings . E_S ###SpeakerA12 . 
81502:24	###so it *EXP*-1 's a nice thing * to move into , E_S ###but , again , it 's not typical in this area . E_S ###You can just spot them because \[ the ce- , \+ the roof \] is so \[ hi- , \+ much higher . \] E_S ###But , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###Well I had n't thought about it in that sense , of the high roofs . E_S ###We have cathedral ceilings in , uh , two rooms . In the , uh , family room and in the master bedroom E_S ###and those \[ are , \+ are \] pleasant . E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###Yeah . E_S 
81578:14	###SpeakerA32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Well this subdivision here has got , N_S ###oh , there 's enough * to put , oh , I 'd say , uh , \[ what , \+ \] twelve feet between each house on each side . E_S ###Well , I 've got more *ICH*-1 on one side than I 've got *?* on the other , E_S ###but I 'm like you , E_S ###I came down from Colorado E_S ###and there was more land *ICH*-1 *ICH*-2 up there around a yard with a big full back yard , which ###here , I look out my back yard ###and I can see the gate . E_S 
81713:11	###I mean , maybe , one snow . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Well , all right , E_S ###North Carolina . E_S ###That 's up there by Kentucky , is n't it *?* ? E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Kentucky ? E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . 
81734:20	###but , I do n't , E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###SpeakerA31 . ###I 'm sorry . E_S ###But Kentucky , we use *-1 to have \[ severe , \+ I mean , just real cold , cold \] winters E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###and we 'd have three and four feet of snow .

81783:6	###Okay ? E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###In Texas , I 'm serious , if it gets cold and it looks like it 's going *-1 to rain , \[ I , \+ I \] swear 0 they close everything down . E_S ###I just laugh .

81816:43	###SpeakerB58 . ###That 's true . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###But , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Do you all have much pollution there ? E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###No , E_S ###not really , E_S ###I mean , * not to see it . E_S

82066:23	###SpeakerB152 . ###Yeah , E_S ###we used *-1 to go *-2 fishing in Lake Texoma . E_S ###SpeakerA153 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , down by Lake Texoma there 's a bunch of wooded area . E_S ###This , N_S ###\[ but , \+ but \] Kentucky 's beautiful . E_S ###They 've got trees , E_S ###and trees are supposed *-1 to , you know , purify . E_S 
82105:11	###I did . E_S ###I could n't make myself quit . E_S ###SpeakerB166 . ###Well . N_S ###SpeakerA167 . ###I did cut down a lot . E_S ###SpeakerB168 . ###I mean I can understand that , actually . E_S ###SpeakerA169 . ###\[ I got , \+ \[ I , \+ I 've \] got \] one vice E_S

82131:11	###Uh , I was n't saved *-1 until I got down here , E_S ###and people down here are just , N_S ###there 's so many Christians , E_S ###and it 's so different from Kentucky E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerB174 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###How 'd you get involved *-1 in this research *T*-2 ? E_S ###SpeakerA175 . ###Um , I worked at T I for a while , E_S 
82157:8	###And \[ I , \+ \[ half the time , \+ well a couple of times \] I 've \] been interrupted *-1 by my little girl , E_S ###I 've had *-1 to hang up and stuff . E_S ###SpeakerB182 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA185 . 
82535:14	###Um , it *EXP*-1 's difficult , uh , * to do it any other way . E_S ###SpeakerB117 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I understand . E_S ###SpeakerA118 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB119 . ###\[ I 'm , \+ I , \] you know N_S ###\[ it 's , \+ it 's \] hard because , you know , N_S ###then you 're not getting *-1 to spend as much time \[ with , \+ at \] home , E_S 
82698:4	###SpeakerA9 . ###And foremost , uh , where we compare \[ w- , \+ that we \] are now doing fifty percent of our , uh , people are voting . E_S ###Uh , we 're probably making a comparison against , uh , some European \[ and , \+ uh , and , \] uh , uh , s-s-say , newer republics \[ that , \+ uh , that \] *T*-1 have very high percentages . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh , so , uh , \[ \[ one of the reasons , uh , that , \+ uh , \[ o- , \+ one \] of the reasons that \] we could get , \+ uh , one of the reasons that it is \] lower in the United States *T*-1 is that mostly we hold it on Tuesdays . E_S 
82754:6	###No , E_S ###I always vote . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Well , I have absentee voted in , uh , New Hampshire , E_S ###and it is a \[ fairly , \+ fairly \] complicated process where you have *-1 to go *-2 pick up the ballot *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Oh , really . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###I do not say that it is that complicated , E_S ###but part of the process also is that you must \[ register , \+ preregister \] at some particular point . E_S 
82786:8	###if you compound \[ that , \+ that , \] uh , eh- eh , \[ th- , \+ \] N_S ###\[ i- , \+ if \] it *EXP*-2 is difficult * to register *-1 to vote , that would remove your eligibility * to vote . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###But I do not think 0 it is difficult enough * to prevent people who *T*-1 are motivated in the first place , \[ who \+ , or , who \] *T*-2 are not just motivated who *T*-3 really believe that \[ \[ their , \+ they , \] \+ their \] voice is heard *-4 . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Well . N_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###I mean , and the people that I have talked to *T*-1 ... N_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Well maybe that is another factor , the motivational factor . E_S 
82866:4	###Well , then how can a democracy work then *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###Well , it , uh , N_S ###well , I do n't know . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###\[ How , \+ how \] can it work *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###Is it working ? E_S ###I mean \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] the question . E_S ###I guess 0 the question *ICH*-2 also \[ is \+ that we discovered *T*-1 , is \] that they do n't throw rascals out . E_S 
82900:8	###Well , \[ how about , \+ how about \] the reverse of that ? E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###SpeakerB96 . ###When I have heard about England 's elections *T*-1 , they are allowed *-2 to run for what , a total of six or eight weeks .

E_S ###What if we totally \[ took money out of the camp- , eh , ma- , \+ \] just severely limited the campaigns so money was n't so much of an issue ? E_S ###I feel like , \[ if \+ , if \] we did that people would have a lot higher confidence that their vote was counting rather than their contributions would count . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###SpeakerB98 . ###SpeakerA99 . ###Yeah , E_S 
82912:77	###SpeakerB100 . ###\[ I do n't \+ , I do n't \] care how easy *ICH*-2 it is *T*-1 for them , E_S ###I do not think 0 they are going *-1 to *?* because they do no think \[ that their , \+ that anybody \] listens to their vote .

N_S ###They really think that the packs , you know , no matter what you 're promised *-2 *T*-1 during a campaign , N_S ###and these days we are promised *-1 hardly anything of substance . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###Oh , you mean the special interest groups ? E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###Right . E_S 
82957:61	###SpeakerA111 . ###And maybe he will *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB112 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA113 . ###SpeakerB114 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well ... N_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###But I think 0 it is , er-r-r , N_S 
82972:19	###SpeakerB118 . ###\[ What about , \+ what about \] voters in the other countries that you were talking about *T*-1 ?

83011:7	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA137 . ###I mean is , N_S ###\[ but , \+ but \] \[ before these enormous , \+ before this \] Voting Rights Act , what we had *T*-1 was \[ a , \+ a \] great deal of our population , uh , mainly the blacks in the south and the Hispanics were precluded *-2 \[ by , \+ by , \] uh , voting laws , uh , \[ from * reg- , \+ from their eligibility * to register . \] E_S ###SpeakerB138 . ###Uh-huh .

83086:64	###SpeakerA1 . ###Well , uh , it seems to me \[ that , \+ uh , that \] N_S ###I do not know whether the jury system , uh , N_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] should not say 0 I do not know .

83310:23	###Yeah . E_S ###And the opposite was true of me .

84425:23	###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA102 . ###So I am , N_S ###SpeakerB103 . ###Probably not . E_S ###But , uh , they pay for my college . E_S ###So , N_S ###SpeakerA104 . ###That is the way 0 * to do it *T*-1 . E_S ###I mean , and that 's , N_S 
84466:8	###SpeakerA112 . ###Um , and that is a very , N_S ###we had never been there . E_S ###That is a very , very neat town 0 * to visit *T*-1 .

84532:8	###SpeakerA132 . ###No , E_S ###you really ca n't *?* . E_S ###I mean , \[ \[ I , \+ they , \] \+ we \] lease out a really nice two story town home in north Dallas .

84619:30	###So , N_S ###SpeakerB165 . ###I think 0 our justice system needs *-1 to be stricter .

N_S ###SpeakerA1 . 
84777:127	###Yeah , E_S ###it certainly does , because , uh , you know , the things in the books seem so dead to the kids , you know , unless they 've actually been there or whatever , E_S ###because I remember our family , well , \[ \[ we , \+ we , \] \+ we \] went everywhere . E_S ###And , uh , * seeing New England and , uh , being on Plymouth Rock and stuff like that \[ was \+ really made \] the whole thing more , uh , visual . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . 
84821:8	###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ well , it 's , \+ um , well , it 's , \] uh , ten o'clock here in Falls Church , Virginia . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Oh .

84892:11	###so it *EXP*-2 's kind of hard for me to tell what *T*-1 would happen if I lived in some of the valleys inland , E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###but the major cause here , and we always seem *-3 to , and it seems *-1 to be validated *-2 by the press , is the car pollution . E_S ###We do n't have too much industrial pollution . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . 
84895:25	###SpeakerB4 . ###but the major cause here , and we always seem *-3 to , and it seems *-1 to be validated *-2 by the press , is the car pollution . E_S ###We do n't have too much industrial pollution . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Um , that is n't the same in the Washington area because we do n't have any major , um , industry except for , uh , government and services . E_S 
84975:61	###That 's right . E_S ###So , solutions to this , would be N_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###\[ I , \+ I , \] N_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Well , E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###you know , improved . N_S

E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###And I think that \[ there are \+ \[ th- , \+ there \] are \] solutions , E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###And that MUMBLEx for buses , N_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###certainly we do n't even \[ need a , \+ need a \] research anymore . E_S ###It 's just a matter of * passing the law , E_S 
85029:51	###That 's right . E_S ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###I do n't know if you ever got caught *-1 in a traffic jam behind a bus , E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Oh , yeah , ###well , E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###That , you know , N_S ###SpeakerB54 . 
85086:25	###SpeakerA75 . ###SpeakerB76 . ###\[ Un- , \+ unfortunately \] though I think 0 the oil companies have lied to us for years . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah .

85129:6	###Well , \[ since , \+ since \] Texas and Louisiana and , uh , California \[ that , \+ in that \] ranking order , the worst pollutants in America . N_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###I mean , I read that the other day . E_S ###I mean \[ Louisi- , \+ Louisiana \] for a small state \[ w- , \+ \] it was amazing E_S ###but it 's the industrial pollution I should imagine 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###Uh-huh .

85413:11	###SpeakerB85 . ###No , E_S ###Virginia . E_S ###SpeakerA86 . ###Virginia , E_S ###Virginia . E_S ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB87 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's sort of unusual really . E_S 
85436:14	###Uh-huh . E_S ###Well , different areas in Dallas have different kind , N_S ###\[ in , \+ uh , in \] Texas I 'll say E_S ###because down in east Texas there 's a lot of red clay .

85473:23	###SpeakerA106 . ###I see . E_S ###SpeakerB107 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and , uh , that 's one of the few places still in northern Virginia E_S ###they have trailer parks that *T*-1 are down around the corner from here E_S ###and , you know , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] still pretty rural . E_S ###SpeakerA108 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB109 . 
85568:164	###Um , so , if that 's okay with you , then I 'll just press one . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###That will be fine . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Okay . E_S ###Well , hi , . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Hi . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Good morning .

E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Good morning . ###Um , E_S \[ I think \+ I mean , \[ if , \+ if \] I start \] this I just wanted *-1 to say that , um , one of the things that I do n't think 0 we really understood *T*-2 about \[ the , \+ the \] middle eastern situation is that they 're a totally different type of people than we are *?* , E_S ###and I mean they think differently E_S 
85582:30	###well , anyway , I just think that , you know , the United States policy over there , N_S ###I think 0 we should just leave them alone . E_S ###I really do . \[ In , \+ in \] a major way because \[ they just , \+ um , that whole region over there , \] I think 0 *T*-2 needs *-1 to settle its own differences within itself . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###\[ The , \+ the \] thing with Israel and Palestine , I believe 0 that should be settled *-1 between them . E_S 
85582:82	###well , anyway , I just think that , you know , the United States policy over there , N_S ###I think 0 we should just leave them alone .

85619:6	###SpeakerB32 . ###You know , \[ an , \+ an , \] \[ I , \+ I \] think that , um , N_S ###true we do have completely different ways of * looking \[ at things , \+ at a lot of things , \] E_S ###but , uh , at the same time , I think 0 \[ there are a lot of , \+ there is a lot of \] good that the United States and other countries can do *T*-1 , as far as example E_S ###\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , , I think 0 some different things *ICH*-2 could come from what *T*-1 's happened *T*-1 , than what we expect *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Well , ye- , E_S ###well , yeah , E_S ###um , \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 we could be a catalyst for their change . E_S ###I , um , N_S 
85690:8	###Yes , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###and I know this only because from personal experience that I 'm speaking of this , E_S ###because \[ I , \+ I 've , \] you know , traveled around town with different cab drivers in a situation where I 've done that *T*-1 E_S ###and \[ one , \+ one \] of the kindest people 0 I 've ever met *T*-1 in my whole life , um , is from that area of the country E_S ###and I mean \[ he is just overly , \+ \[ he , \+ he \] is abounding \] in kindness , * let 's say 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . 
85706:32	###You know , and when you add the , um , commercialization of the western world *T*-1 it sort of screws everything up for them . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###And they have very basic life , um , E_S ###well it 's just a very basic life E_S ###and they just really believe in Allah , or God , or whatever . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . 
85776:112	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Yeah , E_S ###because , uh , the articles that I 've read *T*-1 regarding national health service in Canada and England has indicated that , uh , N_S ###what i- , N_S ###\[ stay , \+ stay \] in line for , uh , four hours * to get an aspirin from a doctor . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Right . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] sort of mixed on this . E_S 
85788:198	###the problem \[ \[ with , \+ with \] \+ \] right now is \[ w- , \+ \] that we 've got too many different health insurances that people have *-1 to go through *T*-2 E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] \[ I think that , \+ I think \] 0 \[ you , \+ you \] mentioned Canada . E_S ###I think that they have a system where , uh , \[ they , \+ the government \] deals \[ with the , \+ with , \] N_S ###I mean , \[ you , \+ you \] go to whoever you want *T*-1 but file through \[ one , \+ one \] \[ s- , \+ particular , \] uh , setup E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Um , I see .

E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Yeah . E_S 
85805:33	###Right . E_S ###Uh , \[ I , \+ I \] was listening , uh , on the radio the other day E_S ###and they were talking that , \[ \[ s- , \+ s- , \] \+ something \] like this , N_S ###I think 0 they were talking about the fact that , um , the money that *T*-1 could be saved *-2 , um , in administrative costs and so forth nationwide by * consolidating into sort of a national insurance provider , um , \[ could , \+ uh , could , \] N_S ###they could make it , \[ \[ i- , \+ i- , \] \+ \] provide health insurance \[ to , \+ to \] people who *T*-2 could n't afford it just by the money 0 they would save *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Uh , we 're currently , where I 'm working now , under Blue Cross *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###SpeakerA15 . 
85823:26	###They 're probably picking up about half of it . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###And that 's a pretty good policy , E_S ###but if you had something like one of these , uh , health maintenance programs , E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###SpeakerA23 . ###SpeakerB24 . ###SpeakerA25 . 
85823:121	###They 're probably picking up about half of it . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Right .

85882:76	###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###\[ Include- , \+ including \] a private room because there was a little extra that she had *-1 to pay *T*-2 E_S ###but \[ that was , \+ that was \] still included *-1 in \[ that pr- , \+ that cost \] E_S ###so .

86032:14	###Morocco . E_S ###Really . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Uh , that was about a year and a half ago , E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###No kidding . E_S ###An- , \[ what , \+ what , \] did you just decide *-1 to go there E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerA17 . 
86482:10	###SpeakerA27 . ###SpeakerB28 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that would be , N_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###but you figure 0 you got some drug guy out there that *T*-1 's got an Uzi machine gun , uh , a thirty-eight , uh , E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's , N_S ###SpeakerA31 . 
86575:25	###No . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###SpeakerB68 . ###\[ Th- , \+ the \] only way 0 they could do it *T*-1 I think 0 *T*-2 , would be * to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###You know , I think 0 if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit , ###course , \[ i- , \+ \] N_S \[ I , \+ I \] feel kind of weird about that 
86592:54	###\[ We , \+ we 're \] getting into capital punishment now . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Yeah , E_S ###but , you know . N_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###But \[ I , \+ I \] agree with you there that , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###It would definitely be gun control . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Yeah . E_S 
86618:6	###SpeakerB86 . ###Myself . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###SpeakerB88 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well and \[ the- , \+ they 're \] actually a necessity in life , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###Oh yes . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###They 're not , you know , E_S 
86685:13	###Yeah . E_S ###I had *-1 to explain that to my , N_S ###I 've got a six year old now E_S ###and he , you know , N_S ###I have a fifteen year old and a seventeen year old , well E_S ###they understand now . E_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB112 . ###You know I 've taken time *-1 to teach them E_S 
86927:31	###And people , \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I , \] \+ I \] guess 0 they \[ confus- , \+ confused \] discipline with punishment . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###You know . N_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###And , just , N_S ###it seems anymore that , uh , \[ if , \+ if \] you have , you know , this type of a moral stance , that people come down on you . E_S 
86946:9	###\[ and , \+ and \] since we have decided *-1 to put everybody *ICH*-2 in jail that *T*-3 commits a crime now , \[ that \+ \] that 's complicated the entire process . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###What I also think that , N_S ###I guess 0 it 's the reflection of the society \[ where , \+ where \] we have so much more mobility and less attachment to , uh , N_S ###you know , it does not seem *-1 to be any responsibility to the community \[ where you , \+ where you \] live *T*-2 E_S ###or .

86975:8	###SpeakerB74 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###However , there does seem *-1 to be a , N_S ###right now in * verbalizing , N_S ###it does seem *-1 to be a higher need for something of that sort . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and then how many , N_S ###SpeakerA77 . 
86990:14	###SpeakerB80 . ###I mean , what you see *T*-1 affects how you think *T*-2 and therefore what you do *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###Yes , E_S ###yes , E_S ###\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 that 's correct . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###And , yes E_S ###but , you know , as soon as you start , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA83 . 
87050:26	###and so we 've gotten together E_S ###and we just do these really elaborate gourmet meals . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###SpeakerA15 . ###And it 's really , really kind of a neat thing 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S ###You , N_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###How often do you meet *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Well , we try , E_S 
87081:137	###SpeakerA25 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###And , uh , \[ we , \+ we \] were a little bit too frequent I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###I do n't remember if we were once a month E_S ###or anyway \[ it was , \+ it was \] difficult . E_S ###By the time 0 we went around it *T*-1 was , uh , four couples E_S 
87434:34	###SpeakerB18 . ###* Being a child , you know . N_S ###So , they kept on and on \[ at , \+ at \] her , E_S ###and in the meantime , she and her husband , uh , \[ were \+ \[ \[ ex- , \+ ex- , \] \+ were expecting \] \] \[ a child , \+ their own child . \] E_S ###And , uh , \[ the , \+ the \] people kept *-1 harassing her \[ over , \+ you know , over \] a period of months E_S ###and finally they , uh , carried her , uh , out into the courtyard * \[ \[ to , \+ to , \] \+ either really to \] shoot her or to go through the motions \[ of , \+ of \] * shooting her , uh , \[ with by firing , \+ or , you know , executing her by firing \] squad . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###And , uh , the Lord just said no , E_S 
87592:5	###\[ he , \+ he \] was so proud of himself for * giving \[ ex- , \+ all the correct \] answers \[ that , \+ that \] on the last one he said , oh , I never remember that answer E_S ###and that clued the investigator that he had memorized a series of answers . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###So , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Well , we , uh , N_S ###taxes , N_S 
87709:10	###SpeakerA41 . ###SpeakerB42 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###But now , * digging tunnels under Central Expressway and things like that becomes cost prohibitive . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###And , N_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###SpeakerB46 . ###Yeah , E_S 
87709:65	###SpeakerA41 . ###SpeakerB42 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###But now , * digging tunnels under Central Expressway and things like that becomes cost prohibitive . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###And , N_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###SpeakerB46 . ###Yeah , E_S 
87715:219	###And , N_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###SpeakerB46 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and the other thing is that \[ when it , \+ when \] \[ it 's , \+ the public transportation is \] established *-3 that early on *T*-1 \[ then , \+ then \] the \[ business , \+ uh , business \] and residential patterns develop *-2 to take advantage of that . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Absolutely . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Whereas \[ \[ in , \+ in , \] \+ uh , in \] Dallas here \[ \[ we 've , \+ we 've got , \] \+ \] uh , those patterns were well established \[ before , \+ before \] we really \[ tried * to , \+ tried *-1 to \] do the DART .

87852:11	###SpeakerB20 . ###And it made me think a lot about , you know , N_S ###you would applaud Bruce Willis in DIE HARD if he was doing this E_S ###but you might not be \[ so \+ you know , so \] encouraging , of Susan Sarandon and then Gena Davis when they do it *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###SpeakerA23 . ###SpeakerB24 . ###SpeakerA25 . 
87902:52	###SpeakerB42 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it was kind of , N_S ###yeah , E_S ###Madonna she 's pretty trashy . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###I can imagine . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###And so \[ it was , \+ it was \] interesting . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . 
87929:27	###SpeakerB50 . ###Right . E_S ###We never quite believed that , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###You never quite got *-1 to , E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###I thought 0 that was pushing it a little bit E_S ###but , she MUMBLEx , N_S ###SpeakerA53 . 
88195:6	###But I was interested in *-1 reading TEXASVILLE before I saw the movie . E_S ###SpeakerA151 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB152 . ###Did you like it ? E_S ###SpeakerA153 . ###Um , \[ I , \+ I \] read a lot of Larry McMurtry books E_S ###SpeakerB154 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA155 . 
88366:4	###SpeakerB62 . ###\[ And , \+ uh , so \] that 's the program that they 're using *T*-1 there . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Yeah .

90440:34	###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB129 . ###Sure , E_S ###sure , E_S ###I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's real important * to have friends . E_S ###I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's real important * to play sports .

90574:8	###yeah .

90762:8	###I sent it , on to the next one , E_S ###SpeakerB99 . ###Yeah .

90794:15	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###So , N_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###\[ That , \+ that 's \] similar to what , N_S ###I 'm in a P H D program right now . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Oh , I see .

90811:21	###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ So , \+ so , \] good luck . E_S ###I guess 0 we should talk about * giving advice , though .

E_S ###SpeakerB20 . 
90856:55	###Yeah . E_S ###That 's disruptive . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###SpeakerA35 . ###I normally , N_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] parents hate *-1 to hear this , you know , E_S ###because \[ I , \+ I \] actually teach college , E_S ###\[ I hate *-1 to , \+ uh , I hate *-2 to \] talk to the parents E_S 
90914:54	###SpeakerA55 . ###I teach at a public school , actually , E_S ###and I know that the S A T scores for our admitting freshmen are higher than \[ a lot of the public sch- , \+ a lot of the private schools . \] E_S ###And , um , \[ I actually , \+ I would \] full time \[ at a , \+ at a \] public school , N_S ###and then right now I 'm teaching part time \[ at a private school , \+ at a Catholic institution . \] E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Oh , I see . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###\[ And , \+ um , and \] \[ I really think , \+ I think \] 0 I 'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school , because I think 0 their parents pay more , E_S ###and I think 0 the kids are a little bit more challenged , because their parents are probably college educated , E_S where at the public school , I do n't think 0 as many parents \[ \[ are public , \+ are , \] \+ are college educated , \] E_S 
90924:33	###and \[ I do n't , \+ I think \] 0 because it costs less , the kid does n't take it quite as serious , you know , E_S ###\[ they 're not , \+ th- , \] N_S ###\[ it , \+ it 's \] the minimal cost . E_S ###But I think 0 you can get a good education at public or private E_S ###but I think 0 you can also get a bad education at public or private , you know , E_S ###I N_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###\[ you have *-1 to really , \+ you have *-2 to \] look around at the school . E_S 
91029:97	###SpeakerA93 . ###So I think yeah , E_S ###that 's important , E_S ###um , . I think 0 it depends on \[ if you want *-1 to be a , \+ if you want a \] regional job or a national job , E_S ###you need that first , job or so out of school , too . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###SpeakerB96 . ###Yeah . E_S 
91352:8	###Oh , that 's what I do *T*-1 too . E_S ###SpeakerA113 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and that 's about it , because otherwise I 'm reading so much for school . E_S ###\[ I 'm , \+ um , I \] have just started *-1 reading a book . E_S ###Actually , it 's for school , E_S ###but it 's for , um , N_S ###there 's \[ a , \+ a \] literary jour- , N_S ###well , not a literary journal , N_S ###\[ it 's a , \+ it 's \] kind of a journal \[ of , \+ of \] the history of ideas \[ that *T*-1 's , \+ that *T*-2 's \] starting *-3 to be published *-4 , um , from U T D . E_S 
91368:18	###SpeakerB116 . ###Oh , how neat . E_S ###SpeakerA117 . ###and I 've , N_S ###yeah , E_S ###it 's really neat because these are brand new books E_S ###and \[ I , just got a , \+ I got \[ a , \+ \[ th- , \+ this \] \] \] one , E_S ###SpeakerB118 . ###Oh , great . E_S ###SpeakerA119 . 
91398:29	###Um , but it 's so long , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] do n't really have the time 0 * to read the whole thing *T*-1 , E_S ###but I think , 0 eventually I 'll go back to it . E_S ###SpeakerB130 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA131 . ###But \[ it 's , \+ it \] was written *-1 , N_S ###SpeakerB132 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA133 . 
91586:33	###on my father 's side we 've really there , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###Uh-huh .

92074:77	###\[ I would , \+ I would \] spend all my time *ICH*-1 in London , or most of my time , E_S ###SpeakerB75 . ###Uh-huh .

94134:51	###SpeakerA27 . ###* Never get them at both places , E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###it seems like , E_S ###so I think 0 we need *-1 to find a new place . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Right . E_S ###Well , * listen , ###\[ they 've , \+ uh , they 've \] had this one , E_S ###well it just , N_S 
94148:6	###but now they , uh , have a golf tournament on the Saturday . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Um .

E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Oh , that 's a neat idea . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and , uh , \[ everyone , \+ uh , they \] get the community building there at Lake Texoma lodge , E_S 
94239:15	###SpeakerB70 . ###that 's true . E_S ###Well , that 's neat . E_S ###I \[ think , \+ think \] 0 they 're really fun .

94358:12	###SpeakerA121 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , Oh , that generally happens . E_S ###SpeakerB122 . ###And , they do it as a labor of love . E_S ###SpeakerA123 . ###SpeakerB124 . ###SpeakerA125 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB126 . 
94401:34	###Well , thanks a lot ###I enjoyed *-1 talking to you . E_S ###Bye . E_S ###SpeakerA141 . ###Been nice * talking to you . E_S ###Bye . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , E_S ###what do you think 0 *T*-1 is the biggest problem ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . 
94431:63	###but whereas like in , uh , a person that , uh , *T*-1 stud- , N_S ###they put a lot more emphasis on athletics E_S ###and things like that are a lot more glorified generally in society , E_S ###and I think 0 that carries over to school a lot . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###So . N_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Yeah , E_S 
94449:21	###SpeakerA15 . ###and part of it 's \[ the , \+ the \] family , I think 0 *T*-1 , E_S ###and part of it 's , uh , the living conditions \[ of \+ \] 0 certain people are subjected *-1 too *T*-2 , E_S ###drugs is a big problem now , E_S ###and I think 0 \[ \[ that 's , \+ that 's , \] \+ that 's \] another root problem . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###you know , I wonder if that 's a root problem or not , E_S ###because I think about that a lot , E_S 
94583:38	###and then \[ I , \+ I \] took a couple of years off and then went back as a music teacher in a preschool , E_S ###\[ so \+ so \] I am around , not a day care situation , but \[ in the , \+ you know , in the \] child care environment E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###so , um , N_S ###SpeakerB18 . 
94583:77	###and then \[ I , \+ I \] took a couple of years off and then went back as a music teacher in a preschool , E_S ###\[ so \+ so \] I am around , not a day care situation , but \[ in the , \+ you know , in the \] child care environment E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###so , um , N_S ###SpeakerB18 . 
94622:296	###in other words , there 're more people , E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###They 're dealt *-1 with , in packages . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###SpeakerB36 . ###SpeakerA37 . ###Yes , E_S ###yes . E_S ###\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] an interesting point of view . E_S ###I , uh , you know , N_S 
94669:119	###and I was sitting out in their little playground while my granddaughter was playing on the things , and was visiting with another mother who *T*-1 was there with her children , E_S ###and she was telling me that she was given *-1 the opportunity 0 * to manage a day care center *T*-2 , E_S ###and of course , \[ she was , \+ she had just gotten \] her degree , E_S ###and she was so enthusiastic , E_S ###and she was excited about it E_S ###and she was going *-1 to accomplish all of these things E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Yes , E_S ###yes , E_S ###SpeakerB60 . 
95045:11	###Uh-huh E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###and we do n't have too much standard software . E_S ###Like \[ I have n't bought , \+ we have n't really bought \] any commercially available software at all . E_S ###So we do n't use it for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that . E_S ###We use it more for just * writing programs when we need *-2 to *?* *T*-1 or , um , doing research , looking at the speech signal and then doing writing , and also \[ as a \+ just as a \] terminal , E_S ###and we connect to other computers *-1 to read our net mail and things like that . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###So , \[ you 've got , \+ you 've got \] a modem in it then . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . 
95112:6	###SpeakerB64 . ###So you 've got a lot of traffic noise real close . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###So it 'd be interesting for the people that *T*-1 look at this signal I mean , because there 's a lot of background noise that , you know , people can hear *T*-2 . E_S ###So it *EXP*-3 'll be interesting how much of it *T*-1 actually gets picked *-2 up . E_S ###Um , yeah , E_S ###and often times that , N_S ###I \[ ca n't talk on th- , \+ ca n't do this \] much later than now , between sort of like six , five thirty and six thirty or something like that , because the traffic outside , they honk the horn so loud 0 I ca n't even hear the phone call . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . 
95196:31	###people told me that it was sort of cumbersome 0 * to use *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###I can understand that very easily . E_S ###\[ I 've used , \+ I 've had \] a class on , um , R Base and also in Paradox E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###and both of those seem very easy 0 * to use *T*-1 compared to D Base . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
95247:45	###SpeakerB1 . ###What do you think *T*-1 about it ? E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###Well , \[ I , \+ I \] feel in light of some of the accidents and so forth that *T*-1 have happened lately , that I think 0 there are some occupations \[ that they should , \+ \] such as the health field , the transportation field , uh , N_S ###they 're already doing it in the armed forces , where they handle weapons and so forth *T*-1 , ###uh , E_S they do it to prisoners E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###so , \[ \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ uh , I , \] \+ I , \] \+ I \] feel like it should be mandatory in some professions , E_S 
95266:9	###And I do n't have a problem *ICH*-1 at all with employers , uh , testing in the hiring process , E_S ###but \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I do n't , \] \+ I do n't \] have a problem with them *ICH*-1 too much , testing even after the fact , E_S ###but I do a little bit \[ where it , \+ where it \] would n't hurt anybody *T*-1 . E_S ###I do n't know , E_S ###sometimes I think 0 they carry it a little bit too far . E_S ###SpeakerA8 . ###Uh-huh E_S ###SpeakerB9 . ###But , N_S ###SpeakerA10 . 
95288:22	###SpeakerB17 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###and as an employer , I would think 0 that would be , N_S ###and the first , N_S ###it 's not going *-1 to be wholesale because of the cost . E_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###Oh , absolutely . E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###There 's no way . E_S 
95340:9	###SpeakerA40 . ###just a little off on their timing \[ could , \+ could \] mean life . E_S ###SpeakerB41 . ###Just , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA42 . ###SpeakerB43 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerA44 . ###SpeakerB45 . 
95476:49	###and the city workers , uh , took them to court *-1 to protest , *-1 saying that it invaded \[ their , \+ I guess , \[ first a- , \+ \] \[ the , \+ the \] \] search and seizure amendment E_S ###SpeakerA104 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB105 . ###and it 's still tied *-1 up in the legal channels . E_S ###They have n't ruled on whether they can test them or not . E_S ###SpeakerA106 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB107 . 
95521:16	###and you sometimes wonder when these people protest so much *T*-1 whether they 're really concerned about their rights , or whether they 're really concerned about something else . E_S ###SpeakerA122 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB123 . ###SpeakerA124 . ###\[ And , \+ and then \] they say , well , if you give them the right * to do this , then they 're going *-1 to take some other right away from you , E_S ###but \[ I , \+ I \] firm- , N_S ###SpeakerB125 . ###I do n't believe that . E_S ###SpeakerA126 . 
95566:161	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###and I have recently , uh , gotten out of debt and everything E_S ###and I will probably \[ ke- , \+ start *-1 keeping \] a little better , track of it . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . 
95656:17	###but , uh , never the less it *EXP*-1 was fun * to see those figures next to , you know , N_S ###* for a \[ pr- , \+ pair \] of shoes was like five dollars E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###I know , E_S ###well even in nineteen sixty-three , N_S ###I found a record that I had *T*-1 , uh , I travel in Europe a lot and \[ I , \+ what I \] had paid *T*-2 for hotels . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . 
95694:8	###SpeakerB68 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Well , uh , we have tried *-1 to , uh , instill \[ some , \+ some \] sense \[ of , \+ uh , of \] budgeting in our kids , E_S ###but our two children are just , uh , as , um , unlike as night and day .

97269:35	###SpeakerA61 . ###And , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Our oldest grandson , when he was eighteen months old *T*-1 went into \[ a , \+ a \] Montessori , day care system . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###And they took infants starting at six weeks , E_S ###and they have a program , uh , \[ in , \+ \] that *T*-1 was devised *-2 by this montessori person E_S ###\[ and , \+ uh , and \] a certain type of stimulations N_S 
97387:11	###SpeakerB108 . ###Right . E_S ###And \[ you need *-1 to look at , when you , \+ if you do decide *-2 to go with child care , you really need *-4 \[ to , \+ to \] \] look at what your options are *T*-3 \[ and , \+ and \] look at \[ the , \+ what they \] offer *T*-5 , E_S ###* drop in at times that *T*-1 are unexpected . E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , N_S ###SpeakerB110 . ###The , N_S ###SpeakerA111 . 
97460:131	###they hire a couple of people E_S ###and , uh , you know , parents come down *-1 to supervise or , whatever . E_S ###SpeakerB140 . ###Really well trained people . E_S ###SpeakerA141 . ###SpeakerB142 . ###Right , E_S ###SpeakerA143 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB144 . 
97472:6	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB146 . ###\[ or , \+ and \] * have some kind of program set *-1 up , like you say , * to stimulate the kids , or educate them in some manner . And have the , you know , the right toys and the right setting and , uh , have , \[ a , \+ an \] organized type of program set *-2 up so that the kids have a schedule , you know , E_S ###SpeakerA147 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB148 . ###that 's real important to little kids . E_S ###SpeakerA149 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well she 's , N_S 
97493:4	###and , you know , * sleeping late in the mornings and things is just fine by me . E_S ###SpeakerB154 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA155 . ###SpeakerB156 . ###We- , you know 0 that works until they start school . E_S ###SpeakerA157 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB158 . ###And that 's a problem , E_S 
97633:57	###SpeakerB52 . ###So , basically \[ that 's , \+ that 's , \] N_S ###well I am done *-1 talking . E_S ###Do you want *-1 to talk ? . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Well , I think that you carried forth your subject matter very well , uh , Nickie . E_S ###And I can , uh , relate to that , uh , E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . 
97653:19	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###And , uh , I think 0 we are progressing at a snail 's pace , E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Indeed . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###but we are progressing . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . 
97754:45	###But , when he gets angry *T*-1 , it 's always over control issues , ###it 's always over power issues , ###it 's never over , you know , ###it 's always , you said 0 you were going *-2 to do something E_S and you did not do it . As if he is the boss E_S \[ and I am the , \+ you know , and I am \] the slave . E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB110 . ###And it , N_S ###those are the \[ only , \+ only \] issues 0 we ever fight about *T*-1 . E_S ###\[ I think 0 it 's just , \+ I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's just \] difficult for men * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] accept women equally , E_S 
97769:83	###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA113 . ###And , uh , the women when they are married *-1 *T*-2 , they are *-3 to be subjective to their husbands . E_S ###SpeakerB114 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###And I believe that strongly . E_S ###SpeakerB116 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA117 . 
97983:10	###SpeakerB60 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###\[ The , \+ uh , the \] oldest is nine , E_S ###the youngest is three . E_S ###He does n't really pay attention . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . 
98194:8	###SpeakerB7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA8 . ###and there are parts of town here where , when they talk about the nightly gunfire *T*-1 . N_S ###SpeakerB9 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###in Baltimore we have similar . N_S ###Uh , I live on the outskirts of Baltimore E_S ###and , uh , we live right outside the city E_S 
98222:24	###\[ \[ That , \+ uh , the , \] \+ what they call *T*-1 the \] latchkey children . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###Yeah , E_S ###something like that . E_S ###No one 's , you know , N_S ###\[ or , \+ or \] fathers are just missing , you know , E_S ###so there 's \[ no , \+ uh , no \] consistency there in the home or whatever . E_S ###There 's no one *-1 to tell them what *T*-2 's right and what *T*-3 's wrong , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###Yeah . E_S 
98259:11	###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 \[ that 's , \+ we 're \] about the same in Baltimore . E_S ###Though , uh , Washington , I think is , uh , close by E_S ###and , you know , they experience a lot more . E_S ###SpeakerA32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB33 . ###I think 0 they definitely have more problems \[ that , \+ \] uh , \[ in , \+ in \] the area . E_S ###\[ What , \+ what \] do you think 0 *T*-1 can prevent crime ? E_S ###SpeakerA34 . 
98273:57	###SpeakerA36 . ###Unfortunately there are often these correlations that *T*-1 are inverse of what they should be *T*-2 like , uh , wherever there are more , uh , criminals *T*-3 , there are more policemen E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###but that 's which *T*-1 came first . E_S ###SpeakerB39 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA40 . ###But , on the other side of it is N_S 
98305:40	###SpeakerB53 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA54 . ###But I think , you know , that there is a lot in the society where things have changed *T*-1 , E_S ###uh , so it 's effected all of us . E_S ###SpeakerB55 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 \[ they , \+ the drug culture \] definitely \[ has , \+ uh , is \] one of the main problems . E_S ###Yeah , E_S 
98335:13	###because it comes a bit from the angle that the , uh , uh , N_S ###it would certainly be an interesting test E_S ###SpeakerB63 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA64 . ###but the other side of it , to me , N_S ###SpeakerB65 . ###What *T*-1 happens if we lose worse . E_S ###SpeakerA66 . ###Uh , y- , N_S 
98340:8	###but the other side of it , to me , N_S ###SpeakerB65 . ###What *T*-1 happens if we lose worse . E_S ###SpeakerA66 . ###Uh , y- , N_S ###well , the other side is that unfortunately some of the down side , N_S ###and I think 0 if I look back fifty or a hundred years I 'd say 0 , you know , back then there were the opium dens E_S ###SpeakerB67 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA68 . 
98381:4	###SpeakerA82 . ###SpeakerB83 . ###But \[ I never , \+ I never \] heard results or anything like that , E_S ###so I never , you know , N_S ###plus , \[ \[ that 's such a , \+ that 's not a \] true , \+ uh , you know , it really could n't be a good \] test because Alaska 's so different than every other part of the country . E_S ###SpeakerA84 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB85 . ###You know , \[ so that , \+ but that \] was interesting , you know , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] do n't , N_S 
98424:45	###SpeakerB95 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA96 . ###and I see , 0 unfortunately , we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and , you know , there 's a million dollars 0 you can have *T*-1 uh , for mental duress or whatever *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB97 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA98 . ###SpeakerB99 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA100 . 
98426:8	###SpeakerA96 . ###and I see , 0 unfortunately , we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and , you know , there 's a million dollars 0 you can have *T*-1 uh , for mental duress or whatever *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB97 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA98 . ###SpeakerB99 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA100 . ###But , you know , the other thing that *T*-1 bothers me in the crime is the , uh , N_S ###in Europe , they seem *-1 to have mentality , E_S 
98427:43	###and I see , 0 unfortunately , we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and , you know , there 's a million dollars 0 you can have *T*-1 uh , for mental duress or whatever *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB97 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA98 . ###SpeakerB99 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA100 . ###But , you know , the other thing that *T*-1 bothers me in the crime is the , uh , N_S ###in Europe , they seem *-1 to have mentality , E_S ###and drunk driving is a good one , E_S 
98436:165	###and drunk driving is a good one , E_S ###* is that people are well indoctrinated *-1 in their society that drunken driving is unacceptable . E_S ###SpeakerB101 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA102 . ###And , yeah , E_S ###if you 're going *-1 to drink , and you may drink , you better have your designated driver . E_S ###SpeakerB103 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA104 . 
98443:40	###SpeakerB103 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA104 . ###In this country , and for example with alcohol or with drugs \[ is , \+ \] we do n't seem *-1 to understand how * to handle it as a society to say \[ okay , \+ it is okay \] under these circumstances , but if you step outside these bounds , the punishment is extreme *T*-2 . ###And we mean it . E_S ###SpeakerB105 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA106 . ###SpeakerB107 . ###Yeah . E_S 
98505:12	###Yeah , E_S ###very much so . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ that , \+ those \] are some important points . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###I , N_S ###\[ that 's , \+ those are , \] N_S ###SpeakerA132 . ###\[ What are , \+ what does \] your city have *T*-1 for gun control if anything ? E_S ###SpeakerB133 . 
98534:38	###or even a panel \[ of , \+ of \] lawyers \[ if , \+ if \] it got to that point . Might be better \[ at \+ \] than just regular civil people . Not knowing , you know , exactly what things are *T*-1 , \[ from , \+ from \] murder on up to like tax stuff , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA6 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###SpeakerA8 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Because I find that , uh , N_S ###I 've been on a few juries E_S ###and , uh , as a say , \[ I , \+ I \] tend *-1 to be around , uh , civil cases because I 've been an expert witness some , N_S ###and , uh , many matters are so complicated that it *EXP*-1 's so hard * to , uh , come up with the fair value , uh , or the fair sentence E_S 
98591:36	###Well , one of the others things that *T*-1 gets me \[ on , \+ on \] the juries is that often in the newspaper , \[ I , \+ I \] tend *-3 to hear two things \[ that , \+ well , that \] *T*-2 go on . E_S ###One is , 0 you often see in the headlines the big numbers . E_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###Uh , and many of those get overturned *-1 or get reduced *-1 in terms of sentences , or get changed *-1 by a judge or an Appeals Court E_S ###SpeakerB29 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###and that never makes \[ the , \+ the \] press E_S 
98600:22	###and that never makes \[ the , \+ the \] press E_S ###and so , when , uh , you or I as an individual gets on a jury *T*-1 we tend *-2 to have certain mental images of what *T*-3 's what because we see the headlines , uh , E_S ###and we do n't have , \[ a- , \+ again , \] a lot of knowledge , E_S ###so we do n't know what *T*-1 is really going on , what *T*-2 is , uh , really the range of sentences or awards that *T*-3 \[ are , \+ uh , are \] actually , uh , in the end applied *-4 . E_S ###SpeakerB31 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA32 . ###SpeakerB33 . ###Right . E_S ###\[ Well , \+ well , \] also what I do n't think 0 *T*-1 is fair , either , is when you have \[ like a , \+ say a \] rapist , come in *T*-2 , E_S 
98643:4	###Uh , such like , maybe in murder they get *-1 to choose whether it 's , uh , premeditated or one or two of the lesser degrees . E_S ###The other thing that juries are restricted *-1 on *T*-2 \[ and , \+ and \] at least to me this has been one of the frustrating things \[ in my , \+ even in my \] own experiences , that you usually do n't get *-3 to hear all the information . E_S ###SpeakerB45 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA46 . ###It 's what information *T*-1 is presented *-2 E_S ###and , uh , I do n't know that juries have a right * to know more because in a sense we call those safeguards , E_S ###but often juries hear only a fraction \[ of the , \+ of the \] story when they have *-1 to decide guilt or innocence *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB47 . ###And to me , \[ how can you , \+ how can you \] make a decision if you do n't have all of the evidence in front of , \[ whether it be , \+ whether it pertains \] to the case or not *T*-1 , E_S 
98654:6	###SpeakerA48 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB49 . ###So \[ the lawyers , \+ the two lawyers \] are the ones that *T*-1 have all the information . E_S ###SpeakerA50 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and the truth that *T*-1 's brought *-2 out is , uh , as I say , when I 've heard about , you know *T*-3 , N_S ###SpeakerB51 . ###Do n't they ? E_S ###SpeakerA52 . 
98676:22	###because stories look very different when you hear different parts \[ of the , \+ of the \] truth *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB57 . ###Right . E_S ###Well , that 's just like that old witness game , E_S ###well , it 's a game 0 kids play *T*-1 , too , E_S ###but , uh , somebody did it , just for your train of thought where \[ they , \+ they \] showed something *T*-1 E_S ###and they asked , N_S ###\[ they , \+ there \] were , uh , like four people , E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###All right E_S 
99045:9	###He , uh , had moved , uh , E_S ###we 're in Plano . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###And , N_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###I 'm familiar with Plano . E_S ###I visited once or twice . E_S ###SpeakerA20 . 
99065:65	###SpeakerB25 . ###That 's correct . E_S ###I have two daughters , E_S ###but my oldest \[ will be , \+ will be \] a sophomore . E_S ###SpeakerA26 . ###\[ Is , \+ uh , because you live in Austin , is \] she thinking about the University of Texas ? E_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###She has her heart set on U T . E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###SpeakerB29 . 
99067:6	###I have two daughters , E_S ###but my oldest \[ will be , \+ will be \] a sophomore . E_S ###SpeakerA26 . ###\[ Is , \+ uh , because you live in Austin , is \] she thinking about the University of Texas ? E_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###She has her heart set on U T . E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###SpeakerB29 . ###And , uh , you know , *-1 having gone to the University of Minnesota , I know what a big university is like *T*-2 . E_S ###And , uh , one thing that I did *T*-1 this summer , which I thought 0 *T*-2 might benefit both my daughters is , 0 my youngest daughter got involved *-3 in band , E_S 
99164:22	###Uh , I mean , it is a different feeling . E_S ###But \[ that was , \+ that was \] my only option . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] mean , I just really could n't look at anything else . E_S ###That was the one and only thing 0 I could really afford *T*-1 other than \[ a jun- , \+ you know , a junior \] college , which I did n't want *-2 to do *T*-3 . E_S ###So that 's how , you know , my decision was made *-1 *T*-2 . E_S ###But , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA62 . ###Well , \[ th- , \+ that 's \] certainly , N_S ###uh , especially today with the cost of college . N_S ###I mean that is \[ a , \+ a \] major , uh , consideration E_S 
99194:28	###and we keep *-1 encouraging him to keep an open mind . E_S ###SpeakerB67 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA68 . ###Does your daughter know what she 'd like *-1 to do *T*-2 ? E_S ###SpeakerB69 . ###Oh , \[ she , \+ she \] has , uh , you know , interests that *T*-1 are just , you know , going in all directions . E_S ###SpeakerA70 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB71 . 
99249:6	###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###\[ So , \+ uh , but , \] you know , I know 0 the summers get hot E_S ###but it certainly , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . 
99275:10	###SpeakerA13 . ###Oh , that 's right , E_S ###that 's right . E_S ###I can remember it not , N_S ###it 's really August that it happens *T*-1 . E_S ###You get those great big cracks in the ground where it 's been so dry *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###and it just gets so dry E_S 
99325:42	###What part of Michigan were you living in *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Oh , I grew up in Dearborn which *T*-1 is a suburb \[ of , \+ of \] Detroit . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . 
99403:31	###SpeakerA55 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###That 's enough * to , uh , do some boating E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###and it was lots of fun . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###That 's right . E_S 
99543:6	###I know . E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###Course , when we get an ice storm *T*-1 , that 's not too much fun . E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###No , E_S ###that 's not fun either , E_S ###so , uh , \[ I , \+ I \] just as soon *ICH*-1 have all the slushy snow on the streets than * have the ice on the streets E_S ###\[ so , \+ But , \] uh , well we have , N_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###SpeakerA107 . 
99558:19	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###And if it 's cold , we say , okay , out you go . E_S ###SpeakerB110 . ###SpeakerA111 . ###I think 0 we must be the only people on the block that *T*-1 make use of that cold weather and get out there . E_S ###SpeakerB112 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###I think 0 it 's fun , E_S ###even the couple of ice storms I 've gotten out there in my ski pants or something and still just been out and enjoying it a little bit . E_S 
99958:15	###I , N_S ###my sister *ICH*-1 was here recently from Connecticut E_S ###and they have a deposit on all their bottles and cans . E_S ###SpeakerB158 . ###Oh really ? . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###We 're *-1 to discuss a little bit about the process of * putting someone in a nursing home and making the decision on a family basis E_S ###and , probably the first question would be whether you 've ever had *-1 to go through that process . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , not so much personally E_S 
100012:46	###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###and she did n't eat . E_S ###She ate very poor E_S ###so I think 0 she was , you know , ###bad , uh , nutrition on top of it . E_S ###And , uh , she got to the point 0 she did n't want *-1 to alone anymore . E_S ###So , N_S ###SpeakerA21 . 
100131:35	###Usually there has *-1 to be some wealth involved * , which *T*-2 is great , \[ \[ if , \+ if \] you 're financially , \+ \[ if , \+ if \] you do n't make the decisions so late that you 're worried about money \] E_S ###but \[ the , \+ the \] places like Presbyterian Village and some of \[ the , \+ the \] retirement places \[ where , \+ where \] they have different levels of care *T*-1 seems *-2 to be so much better , as far as elderly people adapting . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###They 're able *-1 to move in while they 're still independent and still social E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###\[ and , \+ and \] they do group things . E_S 
100137:11	###SpeakerB66 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###\[ and , \+ and \] they do group things . E_S ###And then if health \[ or , \+ or \] mental capacity deteriorates , they 're able *-1 to take the next steps without so much change E_S ###and oh , I wish 0 everybody could go that direction rather than *-1 just all of a sudden moving out of the home 0 they 've always been in *T*-2 . E_S ###It 's really kind of difficult . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I have a , um , N_S 
100301:58	###SpeakerB9 . ###I think 0 it 's a good idea . E_S ###I think 0 everybody \[ should , \+ should , \] uh , put in their time so * to speak \[ for the , \+ for the \] good of \[ the , \+ the \] nation and for the good of themselves . E_S ###SpeakerA10 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###I think 0 it 's , uh , N_S ###would \[ every- , \+ everyone \] grow up and mature \[ and , \+ and \] realize what this country 's all about *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###I just , um , N_S 
100463:38	###SpeakerA72 . ###Yeah . E_S ###And I do think , um , 0 the schools , N_S ###if you 're trying *-1 to do something , even with food drives N_S ###and , uh , sometimes what Richardson and Plano both , N_S ###I mean when you live in areas like that where there 's so much *T*-2 *T*-3 they do n't realize what a small percentage of the world that is *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB73 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA74 . ###I mean , that 's , uh , N_S 
100582:6	###but for those students who *T*-1 are determined *-2 to do well anyway , that , you know , * handling a job was very possible . You know , and that it seemed *-3 to have more 0 * to do *T*-4 with other factors . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###SpeakerA15 . ###SpeakerB16 . ###I think so too . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###You know like , what are their plans after high school *T*-1 , you know . E_S ###And what 's their home situation *T*-1 . E_S ###You know that , N_S ###SpeakerB18 . 
100592:32	###The home is the key . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###I think really is *?* because if the home , does not place a high priority on education N_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###SpeakerB22 . ###SpeakerA23 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . 
100607:40	###SpeakerA27 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###So , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###But there can still be an attitude of N_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###you know , this is a stopgap measure because we need it right now , E_S 
100620:72	###SpeakerA33 . ###SpeakerB34 . ###SpeakerA35 . ###Well when they \[ meant , \+ said \] \[ the , \+ the \] topic , you know , of what *T*-1 's wrong with the public schools *T*-2 , \[ my , \+ my \] first \[ im- , \+ impulse \] was 0 it is n't really what *T*-3 's wrong with the \[ public , \+ public \] schools . E_S ###It 's what *T*-1 's wrong with families . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###SpeakerB38 . ###It 's what *T*-1 's wrong with families E_S 
100664:27	###SpeakerA55 . ###Well \[ we 've got , \+ uh , you know at our school we have \] over a thousand elementary kids E_S ###and last year was the first year that we ever had more than one counselor *T*-1 . E_S ###And that 's just really not enough . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###No . E_S ###It is n't *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###And I was talking to somebody that *T*-1 teaches in a middle school E_S ###and they said , oh , \[ but \+ \] we need more in the middle school because that 's when kids are , you know , at a tougher and rougher age and all that *T*-1 . E_S 
100680:43	###SpeakerA59 . ###Really . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###We have always , though , had three at middle schools because we had about a thousand kids E_S ###and they divided them up between three counselors E_S ###but for a good while every year they 'd have a different counselor E_S ###and they decided 0 that did n't work . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . 
100707:29	###SpeakerB72 . ###SpeakerA73 . ###* To change , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###And occasionally that happens . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###But , it is frightening E_S 
100735:61	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###That 's no good . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###I 'm on that , um , campus strategic planning committee for my school . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###And , uh , one of the , uh , you know , oh , N_S ###they have all these different names for things , strategies and all these different things . E_S 
100740:47	###SpeakerB86 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###And , uh , one of the , uh , you know , oh , N_S ###they have all these different names for things , strategies and all these different things . E_S ###But , anyway , one of the key things was \[ that \+ that \] we believed that the public education is the best economic value . E_S ###Then I think 0 they decided *-1 to strike economic . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . 
100929:25	###but , it was a nightmare back when Cheryl was little *T*-1 E_S ###and this is one of the few churches that *T*-1 did it . E_S ###There were a couple downtown Dallas E_S ###but they \[ were so , \+ seemed , \] cold and impersonal , E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###SpeakerA38 . ###I just could n't hack it . E_S ###SpeakerB39 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA40 . 
101136:8	###SpeakerA122 . ###We try *-1 to work it with their hours . E_S ###And that helps because you do n't have *-1 to just wean yourself cold turkey and say okay , I never get *-2 to see my baby for eight hours a day again . E_S ###SpeakerB123 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA124 . ###SpeakerB125 . ###Right . E_S ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA126 . 
101164:40	###Right . E_S ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA134 . ###But \[ I , \+ I \] do think 0 it 's an area that *T*-1 needs *-2 to be looked at *-3 and improved *-3 because more of us are going *-4 to have *-5 to work . E_S ###SpeakerB135 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA136 . ###Two income families I think 0 *T*-1 are here *-2 to stay . E_S ###SpeakerB137 . 
101164:56	###Right . E_S ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA134 . ###But \[ I , \+ I \] do think 0 it 's an area that *T*-1 needs *-2 to be looked at *-3 and improved *-3 because more of us are going *-4 to have *-5 to work .

101218:29	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB161 . ###SpeakerA162 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB163 . ###And they N_S ###usually , you know , you 'll find \[ a , \+ a \] woman that *T*-1 's keeping like six children or four to six children in the home E_S ###SpeakerA164 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB165 . 
101220:18	###SpeakerA162 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB163 . ###And they N_S ###usually , you know , you 'll find \[ a , \+ a \] woman that *T*-1 's keeping like six children or four to six children in the home E_S ###SpeakerA164 . ###Uh-huh .

101323:21	###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah . . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###SpeakerA35 . ###That 's true . E_S ###Uh , do you have any favorite things that you serve *T*-1 when you are doing a special meal *T*-2 ? Favorite recipes that you 've come across *T*-3 or , N_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Um , E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###SpeakerB38 . 
101432:6	###Yeah , E_S ###it really does . E_S ###One thing 0 I 've run across *T*-1 , recently though , N_S ###a friend gave me a recipe *ICH*-2 that I really like *T*-1 for chicken enchiladas . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Oh yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Have you made them ? E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Yeah . E_S 
101447:18	###SpeakerA83 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###\[ \[ I , \+ I do n't like enchila- , \] \+ I do n't like the tex- , \] N_S ###I do n't know , E_S ###I guess 0 it 's the texture , or something .

101684:15	###SpeakerB192 . ###Oh really ? E_S ###SpeakerA193 . ###Have you ever found out about your kids . E_S ###SpeakerB194 . ###No , E_S ###SpeakerA195 . ###SpeakerB196 . ###not yet . E_S ###SpeakerA197 . 
101714:17	###SpeakerB204 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA205 . ###So we 've really been talking about the foods , you know , 0 for him \[ to , \+ to \] be sure *-2 to eat *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerB206 . ###The lower cholesterol foods and stuff . E_S ###SpeakerA207 . ###and , uh , so he 's eating an apple a day for the last two days . E_S ###SpeakerB208 . ###SpeakerA209 . 
101721:6	###and , uh , so he 's eating an apple a day for the last two days . E_S ###SpeakerB208 . ###SpeakerA209 . ###And all that kind of stuff does really help . E_S ###Well , I think 0 we 've probably talked long enough E_S ###and . N_S ###SpeakerB1 . ###Hello . E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###Hello . E_S 
101869:125	###SpeakerB57 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA58 . ###SpeakerB59 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA60 . ###SpeakerB61 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I mean they 're going *-1 to , N_S ###like you said , I mean , \[ there 's , \+ they might \] be saving money , E_S 
101889:41	###SpeakerB67 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA68 . ###Um , there 's , N_S ###and I think , uh , 0 a lot of it is selfishness . E_S ###People have become very selfish . E_S ###They do n't want *-1 to stay home with the kids or something like that . E_S ###SpeakerB69 . ###\[ Y- , \+ yeah \] . E_S ###SpeakerA70 . 
101952:52	###and you can tell which kids *T*-1 have been in day-care centers . E_S ###\[ It , \+ it 's \] really obvious *ICH*-3 * to look at them and watch the way 0 they act *T*-2 and things . That , um , they 've been raised *-1 in a day-care center . E_S ###SpeakerB97 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA98 . ###SpeakerB99 . ###Yeah . E_S ###That 's pretty sad because , I mean , I do n't know , something 's got *-1 to change with the schools . E_S ###That 's what it all boils down to *T*-1 in the end , usually anyway . E_S ###SpeakerA100 . 
101959:6	###That 's pretty sad because , I mean , I do n't know , something 's got *-1 to change with the schools . E_S ###That 's what it all boils down to *T*-1 in the end , usually anyway . E_S ###SpeakerA100 . ###Well , I think 0 it 's going *-1 to , change in the homes before anything changes anywhere else . E_S ###SpeakerB101 . ###When they 're young *T*-1 , N_S ###SpeakerA102 . ###SpeakerB103 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA104 . 
101971:128	###And that 's \[ the , \+ \] where it all starts *T*-1 E_S ###and if we do n't start *-1 making changes in the homes N_S ###and maybe part of that is * educating parents better . E_S ###SpeakerB105 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA106 . ###And * educating , uh , you know , N_S ###SpeakerB107 . ###* Changing people 's expectations . E_S ###SpeakerA108 . 
102072:44	###I have n't been in there . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Well , it 's good . E_S ###\[ I have n't , \+ my husband had \] been in there several times E_S ###and \[ we went in there , \+ actually we went in there \] for lunch one day . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###And , uh , their pastas were great . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . 
102134:13	###SpeakerA61 . ###uh , \[ \[ we 've , \+ uh , we 've usually , \] \+ we often \] save those and ventured out on , from there , uh , just for something that *T*-1 had a high rating . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###We have found , uh , a number of restaurants either through D \[ and \+ \] the , Friday paper and sometimes \[ the , \+ the \] OBSERVER . Which my husband usually picks *T*-1 up . And also through coupons . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###SpeakerB64 . ###SpeakerA65 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . 
102479:58	###And today \[ \[ I was , \+ I , \] \+ course I \] went back to work two weeks after , uh E_S ###SpeakerA72 . ###Oh , gosh . E_S ###SpeakerB73 . ###but see I do n't have permanent work . E_S ###\[ I , \+ right now I 'm \] working with a temporary agency . E_S ###And so , the second week 0 I was out of the hospital *T*-1 I went up and worked half day on the computers cause you can learn all the software for free . E_S ###SpeakerA74 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB75 . 
102643:44	###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Um , what about you ? E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Well , we do \[ s- , \+ some \] dining out . E_S ###Um , \[ I , \+ I \] do a lot of cooking E_S ###so , um , mostly like when we go out *T*-1 , you know , it 's my husband and I , E_S ###\[ I , \+ we \] do n't go out too often as a family , um , unless it 's like a fast-food kind of thing . E_S ###\[ But , \+ um , but \] we do enjoy *-1 dining out . E_S 
102686:8	###SpeakerB22 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###and , oh , their seafood was wonderful . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Oh , \[ it is , \+ it 's \] fabulous . E_S ###It really is a great place . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Now where is the Atlantic Cafe *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB26 . 
102697:81	###SpeakerA27 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Um , and \[ o- , \+ originally \] the two , \[ the , \+ the \] guy who *T*-1 owns the Cafe Pacific and \[ th- , \+ the \] guy who *T*-2 owns the Atlantic Cafe , were partners in the Atlantic Cafe . E_S ###And then \[ they , \+ they \] separated E_S ###and the guy started Cafe Pacific . E_S ###And , I loved them both . E_S ###I really do . E_S ###I think 0 they 're wonderful . E_S ###That 's our favorite . E_S 
102705:8	###I think 0 they 're wonderful . E_S ###That 's our favorite . E_S ###You know what we 'd really like *T*-1 , \[ if , \+ if \] we just have \[ a , \+ a \] casual evening is Houston 's . E_S ###Have you been there ? E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###No , um , E_S ###but I 've heard 0 that 's really good , too , E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###It 's wonderful . E_S 
102766:32	###And , it was good , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Oh , that 's great . E_S ###That 's , great . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###SpeakerB54 . 
103021:13	###SpeakerB4 . ###In Plano ? E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yes . E_S ###Where do you live *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###In Dallas . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . 
103056:21	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Particularly in the areas where there are industries *T*-1 , uh , where they are burning a lot of coal , and oil *T*-3 \[ up , \+ more up \] north , I guess *T*-2 , uh , E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###I think 0 it 's a bigger problem . With the car pollution , anti-pollution devices , E_S 
103111:26	###It 's kind of funny because people are just petrified , at least some are *?* , at the thought of nuclear . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###So , I do n't know . E_S ###In Europe there 's a lot of dependency on nuclear power E_S ###and they recycle the fuel E_S ###and then instead \[ of , \+ of , \] N_S ###some people are really afraid * to recycle the fuel because they 're afraid 0 it could become , uh , bomb quality . E_S ###But , that 's the only sensible thing 0 * to do *T*-2 , is * recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground . As far as I 'm concerned , where it could eventually , perhaps , there 's some problem , uh , pollute the groundwater *T*-1 . E_S 
103120:6	###But , that 's the only sensible thing 0 * to do *T*-2 , is * recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground . As far as I 'm concerned , where it could eventually , perhaps , there 's some problem , uh , pollute the groundwater *T*-1 . E_S ###So , I do n't know what the answer is *T*-1 . E_S ###The best answer , of course , would be solar or , uh , fusion , or something clean . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Well , we 've got a problem on the line , do n't we . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] get that sometimes , um , E_S 
103146:70	###It must just , be on the line . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . ###Can you hear me ? E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Now I can *?* again . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###SpeakerA49 . 
103191:59	###SpeakerA61 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###It 's just 0 we ca n't control it . E_S ###Right now it *EXP*-1 takes more energy *ICH*-2 * to cause fusion to occur then you get *?* out , E_S ###so , it is n't *?* , ###not at all , N_S ###and you ca n't control it unless you gotten a huge electromagnetic field , E_S ###so that 's not going *-1 to work . ###At least not now . E_S 
103268:27	###SpeakerB11 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###and , uh , another reason , N_S ###\[ one of the arguments , that \[ really , \+ I really \] actually have been kind of ambivalent about *T*-1 it , \+ but one of the arguments that *T*-5 really , uh , made me feel kind of strongly against it , \] is that , uh , you know , someone said to me once , well , * imagine if the person 0 you love *T*-2 most in the world , like your mother or something , if someone killed her , ###would n't you want *-1 to see them killed *-2 for the punishment ? E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###SpeakerA14 . ###But then I thought about it E_S ###and I thought , well , the loss that I would feel *T*-1 at *-2 losing my mother someone else would feel that about that person 
103318:8	###SpeakerA30 . ###SpeakerB31 . ###Oh , really . E_S ###SpeakerA32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Or whatever E_S ###and most of the time I hear myself saying well you know we do n't have enough room left *-1 in the jails E_S ###SpeakerB33 . ###SpeakerA34 . 
103366:23	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA52 . ###SpeakerB53 . ###And * trying *-1 to rehabilitate him , too , E_S ###and , you know , N_S ###SpeakerA54 . ###* Letting him out again . E_S ###SpeakerB55 . ###Right , E_S ###exactly . E_S 
103382:22	###and they 've been releasing people left and right E_S ###and , you know , they 've committed murders and rapes and everything else , E_S ###and , you know , you just think , you know , where 's the justice *T*-1 here . E_S ###SpeakerA58 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB59 . ###I mean , you know , they 're not even having *-1 to serve out what they should be serving *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA60 . ###That 's true . E_S ###You know , I just recently moved to Massachusetts . E_S 
103518:20	###SpeakerB103 . ###\[ So , \+ but , \] uh , you know , I do n't know , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] struggle with it , E_S ###but \[ I , \+ I \] really think that \[ in , \+ in \] terms of like this , \[ I 'd , \+ I \] think that \[ it , \+ it \] might not be such a bad thing . Because , \[ I do n't know that anybody , \+ \[ w- , \+ \] \[ in- , \+ \] I do n't know that anybody \] would feel good , you know , like if you let someone like that loose in your community . E_S ###You know , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I 'm \] su- , N_S ###you 'd have *-1 to be scared to death . E_S ###SpeakerA104 . ###Well , maybe if they could , uh , N_S if they had more money or \[ more , \+ more \] resources 0 * to work more on rehabilitation *T*-1 , N_S ###I mean , deep down I think 0 \[ every , \+ every \] human , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . 
103603:15	###SpeakerA27 . ###Oh gosh . E_S ###Well actually , I used *-1 to play in the Richardson Symphony , E_S ###I played violin in the orchestra for several years you know , E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Oh really ? E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###yeah . E_S ###So , N_S ###SpeakerB30 . 
103663:8	###\[ it , \+ it 's \] a , N_S ###oh gosh , E_S ###it 's like Elijah , or something like that . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###I keep *-2 forgetting , \[ what , \+ what \] she named him *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . 
103831:24	###SpeakerA107 . ###Probably . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB108 . ###So , N_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###Gosh . E_S ###SpeakerB110 . ###but I do n't know . E_S ###\[ \[ \[ He , \+ he 's , \] \+ he , \] \+ the only thing 0 he 's \] shown interest in * wanting *-1 to play *T*-2 is the drums E_S 
103953:42	###SpeakerB26 . ###So , uh , you know , I look back \[ at , \+ at , \] uh , my childhood E_S ###and I 'd say , you know , 0 they were doing things *ICH*-2 then that we should be doing *T*-1 now E_S ###and so it *EXP*-5 does n't bother me at all that \[ we 're , \+ we 're , \] uh , kind of starting *-1 to put the pressure *ICH*-6 on people * to get away from all this , uh , throwaway society that *T*-3 got developed *-4 in the sixties and seventies . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Right , E_S ###right , E_S ###\[ it would be nice , \+ it *EXP*-1 would be nice \] * to see it take a good turn here . E_S ###It seems like it started *-1 to take a turn and then it went away E_S ###so I hope that this time \[ it , \+ it \] stays . E_S 
103967:92	###So , uh , you know , \[ \[ we , \+ when we go *-3 dump , \] \+ actually when we go *-1 dump \] our things *T*-2 , oh , we collect newspapers , too , and then take them , E_S ###* seems like \[ there 's a pretty well , \+ there 's a \[ p- , \+ pretty \] continual flow \] of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###so that 's kind of encouraging . E_S ###\[ I did n't know , \+ you know , I did n't know \] if we started *-1 to do that . E_S ###I did n't know what *-2 to expect *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah , E_S 
103973:97	###\[ I did n't know , \+ you know , I did n't know \] if we started *-1 to do that . E_S ###I did n't know what *-2 to expect *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well I 'll have *-1 to say 0 \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm , \] the only one 0 I 'm good at *T*-2 at this point is the newspaper . Uh , * taking that to the Boy Scouts and my aluminum cans uh , * getting rid *-3 of those , E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###but on the plastic , \[ I have , \+ uh , I do n't have \] any habits there yet E_S ###and \[ I 'm , \+ * guess 0 I 'm \] waiting for the city \[ to , \+ to \] push me in that direction E_S 
104066:33	###right . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Uh , so I 'm glad 0 the city 's willing *-1 to take that on . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###That 's nice . E_S ###I guess 0 they dump it the same place , E_S ###I wonder where they dump that *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Well , there 's someplace , you know , E_S ###if it 's , N_S 
104115:30	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###SpeakerA7 . ###Yeah , E_S ###now \[ I ha- , \+ I have n't \] seen THE TERMINATOR movie , E_S ###\[ but , \+ and \] that 's kind of blood and guts , is n't it . E_S ###I do n't particularly care for that sort of stuff . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Well , I do n't either . E_S ###It , N_S 
104229:13	###because \] I have a ten year old E_S ###so , \[ We , \+ we \] watch a lot of movies around that category , you know \[ that she , \+ that she \] can watch *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###SpeakerB54 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###SpeakerB56 . ###My son just turned two E_S 
104276:6	###SpeakerB72 . ###Well , I \[ w- , \+ \] tell you , ###ever s- , N_S ###\[ my , \+ my \] kids are just small babies E_S ###and , I tell you , ###we really want *-1 to go a lot E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###and , uh , there 's so much out on video *ICH*-1 now , that it 's almost , you know , N_S 
104308:47	###that does sound fun . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###And , of course , you need a baby-sitter for that . E_S ###Definitely . E_S ###But , uh , no , E_S ###I 'd really like *-1 to get out to the movies more often . E_S ###Course , it 's so expensive *ICH*-1 , now , too that you ca n't hardly afford it . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . 
104333:30	###SpeakerB92 . ###That was kind of a funny movie with , uh , Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###That was fun . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###Golly , E_S ###I do n't think that I 've ever heard of that movie . E_S ###SpeakerB96 . 
104334:6	###That was kind of a funny movie with , uh , Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###That was fun .

104335:6	###SpeakerA93 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###That was fun . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###Golly , E_S ###I do n't think that I 've ever heard of that movie . E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###Oh , \[ he 's a , \+ Richard Dreyfuss is a , \] uh , psychiatrist E_S ###and Bob is his patient E_S 
104343:6	###Oh , \[ he 's a , \+ Richard Dreyfuss is a , \] uh , psychiatrist E_S ###and Bob is his patient E_S ###and Bob follows him on vacation . E_S ###It 's , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###Oh , \[ that 's the , \+ that 's the \] one where they burn down the house or something *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA99 . 
104398:73	###SpeakerB6 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###So , \[ they , \+ they \] realized , you know , N_S ###well , of course to them *ICH*-1 a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old . E_S ###\[ That was n't , \+ uh , that was \] a big deal , E_S ###but we decided 0 it was n't worth us keeping it E_S ###and then , uh , T I started *-1 keeping up with , uh , cans there , E_S ###so occasionally I 'll bring whatever *ICH*-2 I 've got *T*-1 laying around the car or the like and throw them in there . E_S ###Least it gets back into the system , E_S 
104408:81	###but , as far as a habit at the house , uh , I have n't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants *-2 to pick *T*-1 up . E_S ###Have you all got the individual containers yet ? E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###No , E_S ###I read in the paper this week where maybe , N_S ###I do n't know if it \[ w- , \+ was , \] N_S ###I guess 0 maybe this week someone may start *-1 getting them if the truck that *T*-2 picks them up is outfitted *-3 in time . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB10 .

E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###and I 've got little children *ICH*-2 here who *T*-1 needed me here E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Right , ###so that , N_S ###SpeakerA33 . 
106204:37	###so . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###well \[ that 's , \+ yeah , that 's \] right that the children have some responsibility *ICH*-1 *ICH*-3 , too , to their parents and such , * to help * decide what *T*-2 's the right thing . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Well , we enjoyed *-1 having her here , E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###And . N_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###but we feel 0 she 's much safer where she is *T*-1 now . E_S ###She still continues *-1 to fall , E_S 
106592:8	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###and we \[ were , \+ \] kept *-1 saying , would n't it be great if we could find another one just like it .

106933:49	###SpeakerB116 . ###SpeakerA117 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB118 . ###So . N_S ###SpeakerA119 . ###Well , it , uh , N_S ###I guess 0 we 've completed , N_S ###do you think 0 we 've been here to in- , N_S ###SpeakerB120 . 
107108:6	###SpeakerB70 . ###And there are , you know , some places that *T*-1 will set up you know for old newspapers and stuff . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###Well , the thing about newspapers and paper , N_S 
107188:6	###I have a friend who *T*-1 just went to , like , Wyoming to some big ranch , you know , where like there were four hundred people for their family reunion *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Oh , my . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###And I , N_S ###so I mean , how I would go about *-1 doing it *T*-2 is I would just call all my relatives . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Because \[ I , \+ since I \] came from , N_S 
107189:8	###SpeakerA5 . ###Oh , my . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###And I , N_S ###so I mean , how I would go about *-1 doing it *T*-2 is I would just call all my relatives . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Because \[ I , \+ since I \] came from , N_S ###my father has , uh , five sisters and two brothers E_S 
107217:8	###and everyone would just bring things E_S ###and my grandmother would cook and cook and cook . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Oh .

107465:8	###And I think sometimes , you know , N_S ###that 's one thing that I have learned *T*-1 \[ in *-2 w- , \+ working in \] elections and things is , you know , 0 sometimes even when you work for someone *T*-3 you do n't really know what they 're like *T*-4 . E_S ###I know 0 there 's been a couple of people that we voted for *T*-1 and worked for E_S ###and when they got in office *T*-1 it was just a disaster . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Well , N_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh , \[ and , \+ and \] I 'm not sure how you go about *-1 really finding out what people are really like *T*-2 before you vote for them *T*-3 .

107635:8	###She says that when her husband died *T*-1 \[ that he said , \+ oh , that my uncle had said \] that he would never \[ ha- , \+ \] put her in a rest home .

E_S ###SpeakerB26 . 
107647:44	###I do n't know . E_S ###\[ It 's , \+ it 's \] a hard decision , E_S ###but I do n't think 0 I would do it to my parents personally . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###I know at this , N_S ###I know 0 I feel like I would never do that with my parents either , you know . E_S ###But \[ I , \+ I \] really feel bad for the people 0 I see *T*-1 th- , ###not very , N_S ###I 'm not \[ really , \+ really \] experienced E_S ###but like I said I just have that one family , E_S 
107715:6	###SpeakerA47 . ###And , It 's really more of \[ a , \+ um , like a \] respect issue \[ th- , \+ \] that the \[ older , \+ older \] people in other countries that I 've been to *T*-2 seem to really have a lot more respect for the elderly people E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###SpeakerA49 . ###\[ and , \+ and \] they really seem as wise E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] in this country \[ nobody really , \+ Yeah , nobody really \] pays attention E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###They 're seen *-1 as senile .

107870:6	###I do n't have *-1 to live through \[ many , \+ any \] of those really , E_S ###a bad , N_S ###I mean , nothing comparable , I guess , to what you 've had *T*-1 before .

109953:37	###SpeakerB42 . ###SpeakerA43 . ###but it 's like , you know , here these people are *T*-1 , E_S ###they 're going to school , getting degrees , making all this money , E_S ###and , you know , they kind of looked at me like I was from the dark ages , you know , \[ like I , \+ \] because I did n't have really all that much 0 * to talk about *T*-1 , uh , where career and things like that were concerned *T*-2 , E_S ###and you kind of feel little bit like an outcast for a while in social situations sometimes , E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah .

110302:21	###I think so too , E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###SpeakerA37 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] agree with it .

E_S 
110347:8	###I agree with that . E_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] would n't be opposed to it at all , E_S ###it 's just our bleeding heart liberals that *T*-1 would fight it \[ to- , \+ tooth \] and nail , you know E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###That 's true .

110929:11	###\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] do n't understand how they get \[ this , \+ this \] reputation *T*-1 unless it 's just that they spend a lot of money , E_S ###I do n't know .

E_S ###You know , I ca n't , N_S ###this is my \[ third , \+ third \] house I think , 0 I 've owned *T*-1 , um , E_S ###but , uh , it 's interesting , you know , E_S 
111163:8	###SpeakerB71 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I love \[ the , \+ uh , the \] landscaping , E_S ###like I say , my brother-in-law MUMBLEx . ###I get to Carrollton quite a bit .

111208:8	###SpeakerA86 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB87 . ###and now all of a sudden it was being developed *-1 , E_S ###and the first thing 0 I did *T*-1 was * planted all kinds of trees , E_S ###SpeakerB1 . ###Do you have any ? E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###Sure . E_S ###I have a Springer Spaniel , E_S 
111243:13	###Yeah , E_S ###I have a cat now .

111433:39	###SpeakerA21 . ###That 's right .

E_S ###SpeakerB30 . 
116879:73	###SpeakerB36 . ###So we put a three car garage in . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###But , even if they had three car garages , they did n't have a work space .

116964:17	###That 's right , E_S ###you sure do n't . E_S ###At times I keep *-1 thinking , though , 0 that might be kind of nice .

119877:47	###SpeakerB78 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###so \[ I , \+ you \] hear so much , E_S ###you get a little tired of it , E_S ###but then again , so many people you got *-1 to understand only catch it once a day , maybe E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Yep . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . 
119922:7	###I understand what you 're saying *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###Right , E_S ###I think that , E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###But by trial and error over the years , I think 0 *T*-2 *T*-3 they got it about as good as they 're going *-1 to get it .

E_S ###I , N_S ###\[ we ha- , \+ we have \] a tent , E_S ###and we 've gone , even with our family a few times out *-1 camping and have a camp stove , um , E_S 
120446:49	###I guess 0 \[ \[ our , \+ our , \] \+ my \] biggest memory is when we froze to death *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###SpeakerB6 . ###We just did n't take enough blankets and whatever . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###\[ Wh- , \+ where \] do you go *-1 camping at *T*-2 around here ? E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###SpeakerA9 . ###SpeakerB10 . ###Uh , we went *-1 camping at , uh , Lake Bonham , which *T*-2 \[ is , \+ is \] pretty close here . Um , E_S 
120521:8	###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###* Go ahead . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###We used *-1 to live in Utah E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Okay .

E_S ###\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] a great place 0 * to go *-1 camping *T*-2 , E_S 
120650:19	###SpeakerA17 . ###That 's right . E_S ###But I had recently gone out and planted mums . E_S ###We had decided *-1 to paint the front of the house about three weeks ago , E_S ###and so while my husband was painting I went out and bought about fifty dollars worth of mums over at Calloway 's E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###and * put out yellow and bronze E_S ###and they 're just gorgeous , 
120690:41	###SpeakerB28 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###And we pulled up almost half of our yard just by *-1 raking it , E_S ###it would just come off in the rake , down to the dirt . E_S ###So we had *-1 to go out and resod the whole thing with squares and wet it and put it down and rope it off and everything . E_S ###It took a lot of money and a lot of time , E_S 
120726:16	###SpeakerA41 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###and some people call them May beetles . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Yeah , E_S ###June bugs is what I 'd heard them called *-2 *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . ###so any how , occasionally I find them in the flower beds . E_S 
120804:4	###and all those variegated , uh , things died . E_S ###So we pretty much go with that dwarf Yaupon and that Yaupon holly , E_S ###and they just live , E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Yeah , E_S ###they 're pretty tough , uh , E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ you can , \+ you can \] stand those . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . 
120817:30	###SpeakerB76 . ###and usually it 'll do pretty well , E_S ###but , uh , you know , every once in a while we get one of these really cold deals E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###and it zaps it . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Well it 's kind of like one of these , N_S ###SpeakerB80 . 
120845:20	###and so , it was about , N_S ###I guess 0 he 's three now , E_S ###so the first summer 0 he was here *T*-1 he dug up all of my bushes and plants and brought them to the front door and the back door and laid them on the patio . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###oh , gee . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###SpeakerB88 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . 
120981:8	###so . N_S ###Gas , I do n't know about you guys , E_S ###but there 's probably at least about twenty-five \[ to , \+ to \] thirty cents of different taxes \[ on , \+ on \] our gas . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###And you do n't realize , E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Yeah , E_S ###we got a sales tax . E_S 
120982:26	###Gas , I do n't know about you guys , E_S ###but there 's probably at least about twenty-five \[ to , \+ to \] thirty cents of different taxes \[ on , \+ on \] our gas .

E_S ###I think 0 it 's somewhere around twenty five cents a gallon . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###So . I mean , they 're hitting us up , E_S ###and they may not raise it , you know , federally as much one year , E_S ###but then they 'll raise it *ICH*-1 somewhere in the state or the sales tax or property tax or whatever . E_S 
121078:11	###SpeakerB28 . ###And I really feel bad about it , E_S ###it 's a plant that we 've had *T*-1 for probably twenty-five years that these were cuttings off of *T*-2 , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###SpeakerA31 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###So , they 're all gone at this point . E_S 
121083:13	###SpeakerB30 . ###SpeakerA31 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###So , they 're all gone at this point . E_S ###Gardening in Texas is really interesting , though . E_S ###I grew up in Illinois E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . 
121104:72	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###and in the winter it turns as brown as a grocery sack E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Right , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###\[ and , \+ and \] I just think 0 it 's ugly . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###SpeakerB44 . 
121110:33	###SpeakerB42 . ###\[ and , \+ and \] I just think 0 it 's ugly .

121153:4	###and , uh , that particular year they had just tons of rain , you know , E_S ###it was raining continuously . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Uh-huh .

125241:80	###and out of each pay check so much comes out of it , E_S ###and you wonder , you know , where 's it all going *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Where 's it all going *T*-1 ?

E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###and \[ that 's , \+ that \] same subject , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Hello , E_S 
125406:8	###SpeakerA17 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###We have n't quite decided if I 'm going *-1 to , N_S ###I 'm working part time now , E_S ###and I do n't know if I 'll be doing that or what we 're going *-1 to do *T*-2 .

125435:45	###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh-huh .

125444:26	###SpeakerA33 . ###Um , you know , \[ what , \+ what \] kind of a structure is it going *-1 to be *T*-2 .

E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Is there like a mandatory nap time ? E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Time , uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA37 .

125466:93	###SpeakerB42 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Um , you know , it 's kind of scary , I guess 0 *T*-1 , because you hear so many bad things about day cares lately , E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###That 's true .

125543:6	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###and then other ones , uh , are the older children . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###Uh-huh .

127250:8	###That 's pretty upbeat , E_S ###so , you know , \[ I , \+ every once in a while I 'll \] put the cassette in and go with it . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Not often enough * to have a routine . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Right . E_S ###I 'll , N_S ###SpeakerB22 . 
127278:18	###and I 'd ride about two or three miles a day , E_S ###\[ but , \+ but \] it would last about a couple of weeks E_S ###and it got real cold for a little while E_S ###so I gave it up .

127885:13	###I know , E_S ###everybody was saying that E_S ###and then , in the paper said it E_S ###so , It should be interesting . E_S ###SpeakerB120 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###SpeakerB122 . ###Oh , God . E_S ###SpeakerA123 . 
128225:44	###SpeakerA15 . ###They have *-1 to *?* for international trade . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah .

128227:6	###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah .

128342:41	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###SpeakerB8 . ###Right , E_S ###uh , * let 's see , E_S ###\[ when I , \+ when I \] went away to school *T*-1 , I 'm trying *-2 to think my criteria .

128676:15	###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB83 . ###And nothing got righted *-1 until he got back up on the ship . E_S ###SpeakerA84 . ###Right , E_S ###so he kind of was a cowboy type , too . E_S ###SpeakerB85 . ###Uh-huh E_S ###SpeakerA86 . ###* Made all the decisions E_S 
128703:12	###SpeakerA94 . ###Lots of little funny spots , huh . E_S ###SpeakerB95 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA96 . ###Did they have Thing E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB97 . ###Oh , yes , E_S 
128704:46	###Lots of little funny spots , huh . E_S ###SpeakerB95 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA96 . ###Did they have Thing E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB97 . ###Oh , yes , E_S ###in fact , Thing has a \[ big , \+ much bigger \] role than he does in the series . E_S 
128771:19	###We 've had a lot of murders drug related and stuff . In Durham , which *T*-1 is right next to Raleigh . E_S ###SpeakerA10 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###SpeakerA12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Well , now , we 're pretty close to the golden triangle , are n't you *?* ? E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ that , \+ that \] N_S 
128788:6	###And , uh , I 'm sure 0 you have a lot of students there , uh , and a lot of researchers E_S ###so \[ you , \+ you \] may have \[ a , \+ you know , perhaps a \] little better economic climate , E_S ###but , in all your cities now , it seems like \[ th- , \+ there \] is \[ a , \+ a \] crowd that *T*-1 's really effected *-2 by this bill . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] \+ really , it 's , \] N_S ###and I 've seen in more *ICH*-1 in Durham than I have *?* in Raleigh \[ \[ or , \+ or \] \+ or \] Chapel Hill .

128792:4	###Yeah , E_S ###\[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] \+ really , it 's , \] N_S ###and I 've seen in more *ICH*-1 in Durham than I have *?* in Raleigh \[ \[ or , \+ or \] \+ or \] Chapel Hill . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###Really ? E_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###Chapel Hill is kind of \[ a , \+ a \] ritzy city or whatever . E_S ###I mean , it 's kind of , N_S ###\[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] sure 0 there is problems with it , E_S ###but it has a pretty low crime rate . \[ Compare , \+ compared \] \[ to , \+ to , \] 
128817:26	###Uh , Dallas is having quite a few . E_S ###* Seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night \[ or , \+ or , \] like I say , drug related . E_S ###Uh , I guess 0 the other thing was that *T*-1 are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values . E_S ###* Seems like \[ a , \+ a \] lot of people do n't hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used *-1 to *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB25 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA26 . ###Uh , I , N_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###Well , that , N_S 
128820:6	###* Seems like \[ a , \+ a \] lot of people do n't hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used *-1 to *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB25 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA26 . ###Uh , I , N_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###Well , that , N_S ###\[ and the , \+ and the \] economy is so bad E_S ###\[ and , \+ And so \] many people have been laid *-1 off and stuff . E_S ###SpeakerA28 . 
128842:26	###and everything *ICH*-1 in her house was total gone , light fixtures , everything . E_S ###And nobody thought any different , E_S ###they just thought 0 she was moving . E_S ###It was 0 a moving man pulled right up to her house , broke in and stole everything 0 she owned *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA32 . ###Boy \[ that really , \+ that really \] takes someone who *T*-1 is bold * to do that . E_S ###SpeakerB33 . ###Well , yeah , E_S ###\[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ it 's \] pretty bad . E_S ###SpeakerA34 . 
128885:11	###and , uh , I 'm over the northeast part of Dallas . E_S ###It 's \[ a , \+ in a \] nice neighborhood . E_S ###The houses here , uh , before the recession were running two hundred thousand or so E_S ###and , course , everything 's down ten to twenty percent now . E_S ###SpeakerB47 . ###Yeah , E_S ###see , that 's the same thing here . E_S ###SpeakerA48 . ###But we have , uh , N_S ###\[ one , \+ one \] thing that *T*-2 effects us is 0 we have apartments that *T*-1 are probably about a half mile away E_S 
128900:32	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA50 . ###And , course , that 's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex . E_S ###You start *-1 letting that happen ###and they go down E_S ###and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things E_S ###so , uh , I 'm sure 0 that aggravates it also . E_S ###SpeakerB51 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA52 . 
128937:15	###What part ? E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###And , uh , N_S ###Provo . E_S ###I was going to B Y U . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Oh , really ? E_S ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Yeah . E_S 
128962:16	###SpeakerA19 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###And it seems like when the winds blow *T*-1 , \[ it 's really , \+ \] it goes right through you . E_S ###It 's really different from Utah 's weather . E_S ###I thought 0 Utah was cold , E_S 
128978:8	###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I do n't think 0 there is any mountains 0 *T*-1 to stop the wind . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###What 's that *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###I do n't think 0 there is any mountains 0 *T*-1 to stop the wind . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Right . E_S ###Yeah . E_S 
129184:7	###Really ? E_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA107 . ###That what my sister did *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB108 . ###Oh , really ? E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###Yeah , E_S ###you might know her . E_S 
129288:42	###so you have *-1 to wonder , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Wow . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###SpeakerA29 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , the cases like that , they should , N_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . 
129396:6	###That works . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###SpeakerA75 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###So , N_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Well , they pushing the death penalty ? E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Uh , yeah , E_S 
129411:10	###Uh , for example , was the guy provoked *-1 ###and was the response reasonable given the provocation . E_S ###And there is a number of questions E_S ###and just depending on whether you say yes or no , uh , \[ you , \+ you \] can give him capital punishment E_S ###and if you 're up to the point where if he still qualifies for capital punishment *T*-1 , then you can look at mitigating circumstances . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###Okay . E_S ###So , N_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###So there is a lot of outs , E_S 
129639:11	###and I bought a Martha Stewart , E_S ###I do n't know if you 've heard of her . E_S ###SpeakerB55 . ###Huh-uh . E_S ###SpeakerA56 . ###Her cookbook E_S ###and she talks about catering and , uh , you know , \[ goes into , \+ goes into \] all that and the \[ different types of , \+ uh , uh , different types of \] parties , you know , different types of foods .

129689:42	###* Let 's see , E_S ###what about Hawaiian luau . E_S ###SpeakerB75 . ###Oh , that would be good .

E_S ###SpeakerA78 . 
130012:6	###it 's been , N_S ###I mean , like the Arab societies and stuff end up , uh , *-1 having \[ \[ e- , \+ effective , \] \+ effective \] punishments E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] they 're extremely severe . E_S ###Uh , \[ I , \+ you know , I \] think 0 to a certain degree , the reason that \[ it , \+ it \] does n't serve as a deterrent *T*-1 , uh , may be because \[ y- , \+ you \] never know if it 's going *-2 to be \[ a- , \+ applied *-3 . \] ###Right , E_S ###\[ \[ un- , \+ unlike , \] \+ uh , like \] \[ in , \+ in \] Arab societies .

131267:55	###SpeakerA79 . ###We just function differently . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Right , E_S ###right .

131801:6	###\[ I , \+ well , I 've \] also found , too , ###\[ I , \+ I \] try *-1 to work out regularly E_S ###and when I am doing that *T*-1 , uh , and feeling loose \[ and , \+ \] that I swing better , E_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] get through the ball better .

132173:55	###and it appears *-1 to work fine for the normal colds and things like that , E_S ###but the expensive stuff , heart , uh , operations and things , they have a managed scarcity .

E_S 
132203:16	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###she came back that , uh , N_S ###we were out at Cape Hatteras when this happened *T*-1 E_S ###and , uh , she got home , E_S ###and the leading orthopedic man , who *T*-1 has handled football people for years and is as good as they come *?* , N_S ###I mean , he knows knee problems okay , E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh-huh .

132524:8	###SpeakerA94 . ###But , \[ I , \+ uh , I \] do n't know E_S ###I still just \[ do n't \+ do n't \] end up *-1 going cause it is n't at a convenient time or I do n't know something , E_S ###but I need *-1 to do something .

132620:24	###SpeakerB26 . ###No , E_S ###uh , no , E_S ###I have n't *?* , E_S ###but \[ \[ it , \+ it \] \+ to me it *EXP*-1 \] seems really interesting that they come along and add another ten percent tax , uh , on top of it .

E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###SpeakerA65 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Maybe it would , N_S 
133051:17	###SpeakerB72 . ###and the bill would have been over fifteen hundred dollars , E_S ###and I had *-1 to pay twenty five for the , N_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Oh , that was great . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it was *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###That 's unusual 0 * to hear *T*-1 , E_S 
133123:15	###SpeakerA103 . ###and that 's a Legend E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###those are nice MUMBLEx . E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###um , but \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a used one E_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA107 . 
133143:6	###SpeakerB110 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###So he 's been impressed with all the Honda cars . E_S ###SpeakerB112 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA113 . ###And . N_S ###SpeakerB114 . ###Yeah , E_S 
133206:22	###SpeakerA137 . ###Really . E_S ###SpeakerB138 . ###it 's like \[ too , \+ too \] mushy , E_S ###and \[ it , \+ you know it 's \] an automatic , E_S ###SpeakerA139 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB140 . ###and N_S ###SpeakerA141 . 
133264:22	###and it shows up . E_S ###That 's one idea . E_S ###Do you have any ? E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Um , I do n't know , E_S ###\[ I 'm pretty , \+ I think 0 I 'm pretty \] satisfied with , um , N_S ###\[ I gre- , \+ I grew \] up in Plano E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . 
133275:6	###so , I kind of kept up with a lot of things that *T*-1 went on . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's N_S ###Plano , uh , improved greatly in the last twenty , twenty-five years E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###that 's for sure . E_S ###It used *-1 to be the pits . E_S 
133283:4	###that 's for sure . E_S ###It used *-1 to be the pits . E_S ###And Arlington is excellent now , E_S ###but I 'm just speaking overall across the country . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . 
133295:6	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###And , uh , one thing , they do n't spend as much time *-1 just teaching reading and writing , E_S ###so a lot of kids are just being promoted *-1 from year to year E_S ###and they truly ca n't read E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###so I do n't know how they expect them to , uh , pass history *T*-2 when they ca n't read anything , you know , even read a word problem in math *T*-1 . E_S ###So , um , that 's definitely a problem . E_S 
133326:49	###you may have half literature for the whole year , E_S ###whereas in another one they 're going *-1 to concentrate on grammar and give you a little literature , E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Grammar . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###it 's up to the teacher , in other words . E_S ###So \[ that 's kind of o- , \+ you know , that 's kind of odd \] to me . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . 
133331:9	###it 's up to the teacher , in other words . E_S ###So \[ that 's kind of o- , \+ you know , that 's kind of odd \] to me . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###It depends on , uh , what school you 're in *T*-1 and who your teacher is *T*-2 , actually E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###or is how you end up *T*-1 . N_S 
133336:13	###It depends on , uh , what school you 're in *T*-1 and who your teacher is *T*-2 , actually E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###or is how you end up *T*-1 . N_S ###Overall , Arlington is good , one of the better ones in the state , E_S ###so I guess 0 we lucked out when we moved here *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###So , yeah , E_S 
133360:52	###and I had never even thought of it . E_S ###Actually it makes sense to a certain extent , E_S ###because sometimes , like a third grade teacher will get kids from second grade that *T*-1 did n't even learn what , uh , N_S they should *?* *T*-2 *-3 to do the work that she is supposed *-4 to teach *T*-5 , you know . MUMBLEx and according to her plan , E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###so I guess 0 if there was a national curriculum we 'd at least have a certain amount that all kids would learn *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . 
133410:9	###SpeakerB68 . ###I did . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Through high school . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh , kinder- , N_S ###SpeakerB1 . ###You think about AIDS research ? E_S ###SpeakerA2 . 
133449:6	###Uh , in the country , America . E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###Oh , really ? E_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###Yeah E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###Um , that 's , N_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###and they have millions . E_S ###SpeakerB15 . 
133536:20	###He 's actually , um , N_S ###he had AIDS related complex for a while , E_S ###and he is now in full-blown AIDS , *-1 really not doing very well , and has a brain tumor or \[ some- , \+ that sort of thing . \] E_S ###SpeakerA46 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it sounds awful . E_S ###SpeakerB47 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a very nasty thing . E_S ###SpeakerA48 . 
133541:14	###it sounds awful . E_S ###SpeakerB47 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a very nasty thing . E_S ###SpeakerA48 . ###Is it just that the immune system ceases *-1 to function properly E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB49 . ###Um , yeah , E_S ###\[ that 's , \+ that 's \] basically it , that , um , the immune system can at first slow down , E_S 
133565:20	###All right , E_S ###well . N_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###Um , short term , I do n't think 0 anything 's going *-1 to be done *-2 about it or probably should be done *-1 about it . E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###SpeakerB5 . ###Uh , are you saying 0 you do n't think 0 anything should be done *-1 in the short term ? E_S ###SpeakerA6 . 
133569:13	###SpeakerB3 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###SpeakerB5 . ###Uh , are you saying 0 you do n't think 0 anything should be done *-1 in the short term ? E_S ###SpeakerA6 . ###Uh , the short term , the recession is \[ getting , \+ getting \] top attention . E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] think that you 're absolutely right there . E_S 
133598:6	###Um , and \[ the , \+ the \] severity of the deficit picture already limits the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting 0 you can do *T*-1 without , uh , *-2 bringing \[ on , \+ on \] serious problems for the longer term . E_S ###SpeakerB15 . ###Yeah , E_S ###exactly . E_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###So \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ that 's \] the current predicament . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it \[ see- , \+ seems \] like \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a kind of a Catch Twenty-two . E_S ###I mean , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] the , um , N_S 
133607:31	###I mean , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] the , um , N_S ###my understanding is 0 \[ what they 're try- , \+ \[ what , \+ what \] supposedly they 're trying \] *-1 to do *T*-3 by *-4 reducing taxes is * to kind of jump start the economy , the idea being that if people have *-2 to pay less money in taxes , they 'll have more money 0 * to spend *T*-5 , uh , E_S ###and if they have more money 0 * to spend *T*-1 , then that will be a spur to productivity , particularly commercial productivity , uh , which in turn *T*-2 will generate revenue .

141685:14	###SpeakerB65 . ###both boy things . N_S ###SpeakerA66 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB67 . ###Yeah , E_S ###but \[ we , \+ we , \] do not have any real , uh , N_S ###like we do n't really ski . E_S ###We have not taken our kids * skiing or anything . E_S 
141747:20	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA86 . ###I had plenty of snow 0 *T*-1 to last me forever . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] do n't care if I ever see any , E_S ###well , I do n't care if I ever see it , E_S ###but * keep it off of here . E_S ###SpeakerB87 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###Well , uh , I do n't mind it , E_S 
141796:6	###I sometimes watch T V if I , N_S ###I guess 0 I watch T V if I have n't read the paper that day . E_S ###We do n't get a paper E_S ###but I work , um , at a , N_S ###I teach a college class E_S ###and , uh N_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###Oh , uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA8 . ###there 's a , N_S 
142122:25	###SpeakerA25 . ###That is the reason , 0 I do n't play over there *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###I like the course , ###but I do n't play over there because , \[ you , \+ they \] do n't , uh , you know do n't allow you to pull a cart . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . 
142167:45	###SpeakerA39 . ###So , \[ \[ I have , \+ uh , I have , \] \+ uh , I have \] children 0 *T*-1 Boy Scout age . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###You must have \[ a , \+ a \] son . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###I have two boys that *T*-1 are boy scout age , E_S ###and , uh , so I am very active in Boy Scouts E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . 
142382:30	###and then we would go to work and uh , come back to the , uh , you know , boat house at night E_S ###and , uh , in the afternoon , you know , it is still four o'clock . E_S ###You have got four hours of day light , good skiing left * . E_S ###SpeakerA36 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###And , uh , it was great . E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB39 . 
142482:6	###SpeakerA76 . ###But then later my mom and dad got a camper E_S ###so , uh we have kind of moved up . E_S ###SpeakerB77 . ###* Became civilized . E_S ###SpeakerA78 . ###Yeah . E_S ###A little bit in the world . E_S ###SpeakerB79 . ###Yeah , E_S 
142624:6	###there are six houses . E_S ###See the people that *T*-1 own the house they , uh , pay for anything like that , that we do *T*-2 . As far as \[ the \+ the \] materials . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Oh nice . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###There are three houses on this street the same color of yellow out of six houses . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###So , I am thinking 0 I am going *-1 to change it to , uh , something , you know , E_S 
142976:38	###Oh , Tom Grieve ? E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] not sure \[ that , \+ um , that \] they 're ready *-1 to get rid *-2 \[ of , \+ of , \] uh , Tom Grieve yet , E_S ###but Howse might be a different , uh , situation , E_S ###and I think 0 you 're probably right , \[ that they , \+ that they \] need \[ some , \+ you know , some \] changes in , uh , pitching coach , maybe E_S ###and , um , N_S ###SpeakerA65 . 
143208:63	###Well , you 'll just have *-1 to plan a vacation some time \[ and , \+ and \] go over there . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I guess so . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah , E_S ###but \[ there 's , \+ you know , there 's \] a lot 0 * to see *T*-1 here E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . 
143382:23	###but , N_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Are you finding it *EXP*-1 tough * trying * to find what you want *T*-2 E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Well , \[ what , \+ \] the problem 0 we got *T*-1 is that we 've got five children E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Oh , boy . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###and so , uh , we really want four or five bedroom house E_S 
143630:21	###SpeakerB18 . ###You sound pretty young for a university professor . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Well , I was pretty young . E_S ###I was , uh , N_S ###I had never intended *-1 to do it E_S ###and I was , uh , uh , given *-2 the opportunity *ICH*-1 after I 'd started a management consulting firm * to teach \[ in , \+ in , \] uh , uh , one of the business schools in the California State University system . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . 
143639:13	###SpeakerA21 . ###At any rate , uh , the topic is fascinating because one of the things 0 I 've done *T*-1 for the past few years is , uh , research the problem from the point of view of , uh , uh , what *T*-2 appears *-4 to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###You may be familiar with cooperative learning . E_S ###Have you ever , N_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Well \[ you can , \+ you can \] tell me a little bit more about it because I do n't think 0 we did that in Utah . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . 
143641:15	###SpeakerB22 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###You may be familiar with cooperative learning . E_S ###Have you ever , N_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Well \[ you can , \+ you can \] tell me a little bit more about it because I do n't think 0 we did that in Utah . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Well , the cooperative learning is a technique that *T*-1 was tried *-2 initially * to integrate the public schools . E_S ###And , uh , \[ what , \+ what \] it involves *T*-1 , basically , is the use of peer groups E_S 
143657:9	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh , I think that the combination of , uh , technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution in the way 0 we learn *T*-1 . E_S ###Uh , I think 0 there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system , uh , that *T*-1 will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster . E_S ###Uh , school systems are , in too many states , dominated *-1 by administrators E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###and , uh , both teachers and parents , uh , complain about \[ the , \+ uh , uh , the \] cost and ineffectiveness that *T*-1 results . E_S 
143662:10	###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###and , uh , both teachers and parents , uh , complain about \[ the , \+ uh , uh , the \] cost and ineffectiveness that *T*-1 results . E_S ###So my feeling is that , uh , \[ the , \+ the \] problem \[ is , \+ is , \] uh , significant . E_S There are plenty of good people , uh , available * to , uh , offer people educational experience , E_S but that we just have *-1 to \[ re- , \+ reallocate \] and reorganize the resources * to do it E_S ###and , uh , I think 0 certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research , uh , uh , of the sort that people like me do *T*-3 * looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used *-1 *-1 to improve performance , particularly , uh , accelerate \[ the , \+ the \] pace of learning *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . 
143664:30	###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###and , uh , both teachers and parents , uh , complain about \[ the , \+ uh , uh , the \] cost and ineffectiveness that *T*-1 results .

E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###And , my feeling is that , uh , those kinds of things will solve the problem eventually .

143673:28	###I do n't know what form it will ultimately take *T*-1 . E_S ###Uh , uh , but , I think that the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we 're paying an enormous price for , uh , inferior quality when the people involved really are n't inferior *T*-1 , E_S ###so it must be the way 0 we 're managing the process *T*-1 that , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I see what year saying *T*-1 , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###I totally agree . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###\[ \[ I , \+ I \] do n't , \+ I do n't \] think 0 \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a matter \[ of , \+ of , \] uh , talented people 0 *T*-1 to do it , \[ a- , \+ both as , \] quote , unquote students and as teachers , E_S 
143862:27	###SpeakerA54 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB55 . ###SpeakerA56 . ###Have you ever used Discover card ? E_S ###SpeakerB57 . ###No , E_S ###I have n't *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA58 . ###Yeah , E_S

143989:24	###SpeakerA110 . ###Bye-bye . E_S ###SpeakerB111 . ###Bye . E_S ###SpeakerB1 . ###Well , as far as I 'm concerned \[ and \+ \] it 's probably apt that your call 's at this time because we just got through *-2 watching , uh , REASONABLE DOUBTS .

144004:42	###SpeakerA6 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###well , I think 0 , you know , \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] in that same , E_S ###I think 0 \[ \[ if it 's , \+ uh , if it 's a con- , \] \+ if it 's a convicted , \] uh , felon on parole uh , and he goes out \[ and , \+ and \] commits another crime or kills somebody , \[ \[ I , \+ you know , I , \] \+ I \] feel the same way , E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###Uh-huh .

144139:31	###SpeakerB63 . ###He was too far away when it happened *T*-1 .

E_S ###SpeakerA64 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB65 . 
144216:6	###Oh , I know , E_S ###I 'm , N_S ###yeah , E_S ###\[ I saw the w- , \+ I saw \[ the Warriors , \+ uh , just a little bit of the highlights of the Warriors , \] uh , Dallas game .

144275:11	###SpeakerB38 . ###It 's unbelievable . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###How do people in Texas deal with Dallas , Houston and San Antonio *T*-1 . E_S ###Do you , for example , like San Antonio in Dallas ? E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###SpeakerB42 . ###Well , \[ actually , \+ actually , \] \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] Dallas area here , uh , pulls for Dallas . E_S 
144276:6	###It 's unbelievable . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###How do people in Texas deal with Dallas , Houston and San Antonio *T*-1 . E_S ###Do you , for example , like San Antonio in Dallas ?

144291:25	###There really , N_S ###I mean , not a whole lot .

E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's true , E_S 
144474:50	###SpeakerB46 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###SpeakerB48 . ###Well , that 's true . E_S ###That 's true because , uh , it 's \[ a , \+ such an \] easily preventable disease . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###SpeakerB50 . ###SpeakerA51 . ###Right , E_S 
144646:29	###SpeakerB132 . ###I do n't know . E_S ###SpeakerA133 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB134 . ###\[ But , \+ uh , but \] I 've never looked into how much money they 're spending *T*-1 . E_S ###\[ I have , \+ I have \] no idea . E_S ###SpeakerA135 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB136 . 
144775:37	###SpeakerA23 . ###Unfortunately yes . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###SpeakerA25 . ###SpeakerB26 . ###That 's too bad . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###SpeakerA29 . 
144943:66	###but , the roles that women have played *T*-1 in the last \[ pup- , \+ \] \[ couple of year in our , \+ or couple of generations . \] N_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###That , N_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###SpeakerB4 . ###Right . E_S ###Well , they 've entered the work force more , uh , you know , since World War Two is when they started *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###You bet . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . 
144978:74	###You know , why not . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###You bet . E_S ###That 's sort of neat . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###So \[ \[ that , \+ that 's \] a , \+ I think 0 that 's a \] change E_S ###and I think 0 that 's a change 0 you 're going *-1 to be seeing more of *T*-2 \[ in the , \+ in the \] future , people having that kind of attitude that the father 's going *-3 to take more active role in child rearing . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Sure . E_S ###I think , uh , 0 it 's the age old thing , E_S 
145166:123	###Uh , she 's , N_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###I was a professor in a university here in California for a while . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah , E_S ###uh , are you going *-1 to , uh , put your son in child care in \[ a , \+ a \] year or two ? E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Uh , probably . Uh , E_S 
145178:23	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###because my wife will be doing her internship that semester . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###It will be forty hour week , \[ not , \+ no , \] eight to five type of thing . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . 
145182:8	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###It will be forty hour week , \[ not , \+ no , \] eight to five type of thing . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###So , depending on what my class schedule looks like *T*-1 , he may spend \[ four , \+ \[ si- , \+ \] anywhere from four *RNR*-2 \+ \] to eight *RNR*-2 hours a day in child care at that point . E_S ###Right now we 're trying *-1 to avoid it , E_S ###but we just , as a matter of fact just yesterday hired \[ a , \+ a \] girl *-1 to , uh , watch him . E_S ###Uh , I get out of class at certain time E_S 
145233:8	###SpeakerB52 . ###They 've got three daughters .

E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . 
145312:113	###Well , it 's best , ###SpeakerB90 . ###SpeakerA91 . ###Yeah , E_S ###a cottage industry 's the best way 0 * to do it *T*-1 really , E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###Well , it is the best way 0 * to do it *T*-1 , interestingly . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###because if you over , N_S ###SpeakerB94 . 
145632:50	###Well , that sounds great , Ellen . E_S ###How far away do they come from *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###Uh , \[ they come from , \+ well , they all meet \] in Portland E_S ###and they come as far as , oh , Seattle E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] sometimes we 've gone E_S ###and \[ we were f- , \+ we were \] living in Utah at the time . E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA6 . 
145644:52	###and people would come from Seattle to there \[ and , \+ \] uh , * let 's see , Nevada and in that area , Washington and Nevada to southern Utah E_S ###and \[ they would , uh , assign a different person , \+ each time 0 they had a reunion *T*-1 they 'd assign a different person \] to be in charge of * notifying everybody . E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###Oh , okay , E_S ###that makes sense . E_S ###Nobody 's out of a lot of trouble more than once . E_S ###SpeakerA8 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah E_S ###and the people who *T*-1 are down there , like , they 'll assign one person in the Utah area , one person in the Washington area E_S 
145702:16	###and they had people come in from out of town E_S ###and they took some rooms down at a Holiday Inn E_S ###and , uh , they had some activity , E_S ###they had a nice dinner planned *-1 and all of that stuff E_S ###and people got up and talked about various parts of the family tree E_S ###and , you know , a lot of that sort of thing . E_S ###Since it was the first one that we 'd had *T*-1 \[ that , \+ you could do that \] once . E_S ###Now next time 0 we have one *T*-1 , E_S we 'll have *-1 to think of something more creative 0 *-3 to do *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###Well , you know , that 's interesting because one thing that *T*-1 always brings to my , uh , husband 's mother 's side together is , uh , 0 they talk about the genealogy of the family tree every time E_S 
145710:9	###SpeakerA30 . ###Well , you know , that 's interesting because one thing that *T*-1 always brings to my , uh , husband 's mother 's side together is , uh , 0 they talk about the genealogy of the family tree every time E_S ###and , uh , inevitably everyone is just very interested E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] they always have , you know , two or three new ones 0 *-1 to add *T*-2 to the list , you know , ###someone 's been born *-1 ###or someone passed away ###or , you know , something like that E_S ###SpeakerB31 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA32 . 
145885:14	###SpeakerB56 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###SpeakerB58 . ###Yeah , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###I think 0 today the thing that I , uh , would appreciate *T*-1 the most , N_S 
146202:38	###SpeakerB54 . ###I think 0 when babies , N_S ###I think 0 afghans \[ and , \+ and \] the crocheted little sweaters , \[ and , \+ \] \[ are , \+ are \] wonderful . E_S ###\[ And , \+ and \] they 'll wear them . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Yes , E_S ###exactly . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Once they get old enough * to talk then they no longer will wear them . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . 
146345:60	###but \[ I like , \+ I like \] both of them . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I do too . E_S ###I have a brother-in-law who *T*-1 really likes the old ones a lot , E_S ###I mean , he almost hates the new ones . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Really ? E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Yeah , E_S 
146369:20	###I mean , \[ you , \+ you \] learn more about the characters and stuff , E_S ###but that 's the way 0 all shows are *T*-1 now . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah , E_S ###sure . E_S ###Well , * let 's see . E_S ###Um , I like *-1 to watch COLOMBO because it 's like a mystery thing . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . 
146370:6	###but that 's the way 0 all shows are *T*-1 now . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah , E_S ###sure . E_S ###Well , * let 's see . E_S ###Um , I like *-1 to watch COLOMBO because it 's like a mystery thing . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###That 's sort of how Matlock is *T*-1 , E_S 
146490:6	###SpeakerB86 . ###But it 's all over now . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###Oh , another show 0 I like *-1 to watch *T*-2 is MASH . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Hello . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Hello . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Hi , E_S 
146494:6	###SpeakerA1 . ###Hello . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Hello . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Hi , E_S ###my name is Dolphene . E_S ###I live in Texas . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Hi , E_S

E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###And how do you feel *T*-1 about * putting someone in the nursing home ? E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Well , I do n't think that uh , any of my relatives would really like *-1 to go there . E_S 
146553:13	###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###SpeakerB26 . ###I do think that there are some significant kinds of things 0 * to to look for *T*-4 *ICH*-1 , you know , if you are faced *-2 with * placing someone .

E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . 
146596:60	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###SpeakerB44 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Uh , \[ the , \+ the \] attitude of the staff as you said is really very very important . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###SpeakerB48 .

E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Yes E_S ###and that can , N_S ###SpeakerB1 . ###Okay , E_S ###so now what are your opinions on recycling *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###Well , I definitely think that we need *-1 to start *-2 recycling . E_S ###I think 0 it has got *-1 to be an individual responsibility until , N_S 
146696:35	###There is no really recycling facilities . E_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###No . E_S ###We have a pilot program in Arlington *ICH*-1 *-2 going on I think in the north part of the city where they \[ are \+ have \] \[ people \+ people \] separate \[ the garbage as , \+ the trash as \] they put it out *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###I think 0 that is a good idea . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###And I think 0 that is what it is going *-1 to have *-2 to come to *T*-3 . Where we are just forced *-4 to *T*-5 .

150739:8	###It *EXP*-1 is amazing how fast you take off the inches *T*-2 E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB55 . ###Uh , also one thing that *T*-1 's helpful , E_S ###and I do n't know if your family 's spread out or whatever E_S ###SpeakerA56 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB57 . 
151863:6	###and , it 's so and such days from such and such date E_S ###SpeakerA60 . ###SpeakerB61 . ###SpeakerA62 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB63 . ###and everybody just shows up . E_S ###SpeakerA64 . ###Oh , well , \[ that is , \+ that is \] helpful . E_S ###Yeah , E_S 
151863:51	###and , it 's so and such days from such and such date E_S ###SpeakerA60 . ###SpeakerB61 . ###SpeakerA62 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB63 . ###and everybody just shows up . E_S ###SpeakerA64 . ###Oh , well , \[ that is , \+ that is \] helpful . E_S ###Yeah , E_S 
151907:13	###Nobody *ICH*-1 moves away except us . E_S ###SpeakerA80 . ###They must really like it there . E_S ###SpeakerB81 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I got out as soon as I graduated . E_S ###SpeakerA82 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB83 . 
151990:25	###Um , yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###I hate *-1 to see a car *ICH*-3 *ICH*-2 going down the street , or even a truck or bus for that matter , that *T*-4 's putting out a lot of dark smoke , E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###and I know 0 there 's a lot of pollutants 0 we ca n't even see *T*-1 coming out of cars , E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . 
152010:23	###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###SpeakerA35 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###SpeakerA37 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Diesel is going *-1 to be around , because it does n't evaporate easily , E_S ###and it 's got , N_S 
152022:15	###That 's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios *T*-2 \[ as the , \+ as the \] air is heated *-1 , you know , by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Oh , I see . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###SpeakerA41 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . 
152188:17	###But we got *-1 to see a lot of deer um , out and about E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###and there 's , N_S ###of course , we see smaller animals all the time , E_S ###and , uh , one thing that *T*-1 is a big concern in the evening , at night , uh , is , uh , make * sure that all the food 's put *-2 away and so forth because , uh , we have , uh , armadillos . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . 
152354:16	###\[ and , \+ and \] if you have it great , E_S ###if you do n't , you 're kind of out of luck E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###but , um , it was kind of an interesting show . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###I think 0 you 're right , E_S 
152387:8	###Great . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###and , uh , \[ it , \+ it \] covers the bulk of the dental expenses . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###\[ Is that , \+ uh , * let me interrupt , is that \] the same for both , uh , professors \[ and , \+ and \] also staff and administration , E_S ###is that generally across the board , do you think *T*-1 E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Uh , yes , E_S ###it is *?* . E_S 
152396:10	###it is *?* . E_S ###The benefits plan is different \[ for operating , \+ for what we call *T*-1 operating \] staff , which *T*-2 are considered *-3 to be , uh , clerical personnel , accountants , things like that as opposed to what they call *T*-4 the P A T staff , which I belong to *T*-5 E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###SpeakerA61 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###but the main , N_S ###I think 0 \[ the , \+ the \] health and all that and the dental *ICH*-1 is the same for everybody , and the retirement plan . E_S 
152453:45	###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###They 're also important . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I guess 0 one of the differences 0 I see *T*-1 is , uh , 0 * working for a university , uh , there is room for advancement , but not so much so , \[ our \+ \] in , uh , quite a highly unionized environment and then also in the administrative association E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###so there is a progressive path , E_S 
152560:9	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###SpeakerB48 . ###Yeah , E_S ###but , N_S ###so what else do you think 0 *T*-1 is important ? E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Well the , uh , N_S ###that 's maybe the majority of the importance , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###Yeah , E_S 
152561:57	###SpeakerA47 . ###SpeakerB48 . ###Yeah , E_S ###but , N_S ###so what else do you think 0 *T*-1 is important ? E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Well the , uh , N_S ###that 's maybe the majority of the importance , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###because my perspective is from an institution , E_S 
152682:23	###And I guess 0 that 's what I am concerned with *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###I , guess 0 \[ I , \+ I \] definitely agree with you , E_S ###but \[ sin- , \+ \] the N_S ###well , what I do n't like *T*-1 about , uh , \[ sentence , \+ the jury doing the sentencing \] in that I think 0 it becomes a lot less , N_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . 
152754:68	###it 's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###And they are very effective too . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###That the , N_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###SpeakerA67 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Uh , even , N_S 
152769:96	###SpeakerA71 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Uh , the city has dropped their charges against him because \[ their , \+ the \] attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt * to convince the judge . E_S ###So I do n't know . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Uh , this is a little bit of the subject , E_S ###but \[ one , \+ one \] thing that I really dislike *T*-1 , uh , also \[ that *T*-2 's , \+ that *T*-3 's \] new \[ is the , uh , \+ is that \] I have heard that there are federal sentences , E_S ###SpeakerA1 . 
152848:16	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Uh , \[ it , \+ it \] really , uh , N_S ###I should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube \[ because , \+ ###Right ###because , \] uh , there 's an old saying *ICH*-1 in amongst taxes and politicians that there 's a fly paper effect E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Yeah . E_S ###There you go *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . 
152941:44	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Huh . E_S ###I will agree to that . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###I think 0 your taxes in Wisconsin are pretty high . \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ if I \] am not mistaken , are n't they *?* ? ###I mean for your state . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerA57 . 
152949:6	###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###\[ What is , \+ do you know what \] your state income tax rate is *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Um , no E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Twenty percent ? E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] have no idea , E_S ###I just . N_S 
152996:6	###so I get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which *T*-1 \[ is \+ really is n't \] too great sometimes . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###SpeakerB10 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I usually tend *-1 to just , you know , rely on , you know , T V , uh , again , you know , just through the grapevine \[ just , \+ just \] to know like , you know like what today 's stories are *T*-2 E_S ###and I usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know I 'm interested in any particular one . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Yeah . E_S 
153003:18	###and I usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know I 'm interested in any particular one . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Yeah . E_S ###The radio does n't really have much news sometimes . E_S ###The stations 0 I listen to *T*-1 are just mainly music . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 you pretty much have *-1 to listen to all news station * to get any news at all .

153007:65	###The stations 0 I listen to *T*-1 are just mainly music . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 you pretty much have *-1 to listen to all news station * to get any news at all .

153043:38	###\[ they 're , \+ * looks like they 're \] going more *ICH*-1 for ratings than for you know actual news . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###I think , you know 0 \[ the \+ probably the \] best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###they typically have a better . N_S ###I am from a small town too here in Texas 
153162:42	###SpeakerB76 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###and they kind of you know , N_S ###if they were going *-1 to show that why did n't they show the guys who you know *T*-2 got really hurt *-3 and everything *T*-4 . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###SpeakerB80 . ###Yeah , E_S 
153183:21	###SpeakerA5 . ###I heard a laugh in the background . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's the boys . E_S ###They know 0 I do n't like it . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Do n't you like cats ? E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Well , I like cats . E_S 
153202:10	###That 's odd . E_S ###How does he treat the other people *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###* Just , uh , stays away or runs usually . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Wow . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###But \[ he follows , \+ he 'll follow \] my oldest son around . E_S ###You know when he is in the house *T*-1 , he will come up ###and he 'll jump on his lap , E_S 
153243:21	###SpeakerA29 . ###and she use *-1 to work for a \[ veter- , \+ veterinarian \] E_S ###so she would \[ spay- , \+ uh , neuter \] them give them all their shots E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###and we saw an ad saying 0 it was free , E_S ###so we went down there and picked it up E_S ###and it 's been an excellent dog , E_S ###but it 's my first dog 0 I 've had *T*-1 E_S 
153472:19	###Uh , I 'm not really sure how bad it is *T*-1 . E_S ###\[ I 've , \+ I 've \] not really had that many problems with it , E_S ###but I mean apparently \[ we , \+ we \] were ranked *-1 pretty high up . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Yeah E_S ###I know 0 Dallas is *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Uh . I mean , I think , you know , in the te- , N_S ###I mean I think 0 we have been like ranked *-1 in one of the top three for murders in the last few years . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . 
153492:12	###I would probably get like a shotgun . E_S ###Just for * protecting myself . You know , from burglar type thing . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###I do kind of live in the downtown area . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###You know and shotguns are really good because they 're , N_S 
153514:11	###I mean a shotgun just really struck me as *-1 being you know a real good defensive weapon . E_S ###You can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of you know whoever . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###SpeakerB52 . ###Well , Well , now when I first moved to Dallas *T*-1 , I moved up here by myself E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###You pretty much stop them . E_S ###And , you do n't , N_S 
153541:21	###SpeakerA61 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###SpeakerA63 . ###SpeakerB64 . ###SpeakerA65 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ that , \+ that \] really does scare me .

153652:16	###SpeakerB18 . ###I 've got a money market account that I do a lot of uh , uh , saving in *T*-1 E_S ###and I also have got a checking account besides that , E_S ###but , what I do *T*-2 on my money market account , my taxes for instance which *T*-1 amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month . I will just take two hundred and twenty out E_S ###and I put it in parenthesis . E_S ###I take it out of the right line total and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Every month I add two hundred and twenty dollars to it . E_S 
153677:6	###So , I kind of have \[ a , \+ an \] amount in my mind E_S ###and I am making every effort *-2 \[ to , \+ to \] \[ sal- , \+ put \] a little bit away and increase the amount that I need *T*-1 for a down payment or whatever . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###Uh , cars are definitely something that you have *-1 to figure *T*-2 into your budget .

153707:6	###SpeakerB36 . ###SpeakerA37 . ###Have you thought about , uh , leasing ? E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Well , uh , I have thought about it , E_S ###but leasing would n't , N_S you know , ###I do n't use it for my business . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###I see . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . 
153790:9	###SpeakerA11 . ###You know , even if they give it a shot , it 's still going *-1 to be black market all over the place , you know , E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###That 's right . E_S ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###I do n't know . E_S ###* Coming from Texas you 're probably , N_S ###I do n't know E_S ###I should n't make stereo types , E_S 
154252:26	###Uh , about \[ every , \+ every \] three months or so , we re-evaluate our budget E_S ###and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###and then we divvy them up between our four pay checks . E_S ###I work part time at night E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Wow . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . 
154312:32	###SpeakerA37 . ###SpeakerB38 . ###and it *EXP*-1 was easy * to , uh , let things get out of hand . E_S ###We \[ thought it \+ , uh , thought it \] to be really helpful . E_S ###We have gotten some of our loans paid *-1 off really because of this and stuff like that E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###so , N_S ###SpeakerA41 . 
154787:73	###SpeakerA21 . ###and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get *?* to them . Because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Well , that 's good . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###So one of the real keys , it sounds like *T*-1 , to * getting recycling for , uh , paper or something like that to go is * to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Right . E_S ###There has *-1 to be , uh , a reuse for it . E_S ###I mean , that 's why they recycle *T*-1 . E_S 
154874:14	###Well first of all \[ I , \+ I \] \[ ha- , \+ have \] *-1 to ask you \[ how , \+ how \] old you are *T*-2 ? E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Oh , I am twenty-seven . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Twenty-seven , E_S ###okay . E_S ###Well , I am quite a bit older than you are *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###SpeakerB8 . ###But , no . E_S 
154971:10	###and that 's what I do *T*-1 every day . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Oh , great . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###SpeakerB42 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Do you play every day ? E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Yeah , E_S ###pretty much . E_S 
155154:8	###and then I went horseback riding E_S ###and still I was so sore E_S ###and I could n't get over , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Hey Steve . E_S ###Uh , \[ They just , \+ uh , they just \] started a recycling program here , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###Actually , this is my first experience with recycling program E_S ###but , uh , instead of *-2 just like tossing everything away which I always felt bad about *T*-1 , uh , I am starting *-2 to \[ split stu- , \+ split stuff \] up . E_S 
155199:31	###SpeakerB12 . ###So , did they , N_S ###\[ you 're giving , \+ are you giving \] these products to the handicapped group E_S ###and the handicapped group is getting the uh , the money E_S ###\[ \[ or \+ or are you , \] \+ or are \[ they \+ some home \] \] distributing the funds back to you . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Well , actually \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] the opportunity for both . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Oh . Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . 
155201:28	###\[ you 're giving , \+ are you giving \] these products to the handicapped group E_S ###and the handicapped group is getting the uh , the money E_S ###\[ \[ or \+ or are you , \] \+ or are \[ they \+ some home \] \] distributing the funds back to you . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Well , actually \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] the opportunity for both . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Oh . Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Generally \[ the , \+ uh , the \] handicapped group takes care of the things that N_S ###actually , the government has placed the deposit which *T*-1 is the inducement * to \[ re- , \+ recycle \] the bottle so that you get your money back E_S 
155216:8	###but what they do *T*-1 is * employ , uh , \[ homeless , \+ I think mostly men , but homeless \] people to uh , go out and collect all the recyclable cans E_S ###\[ and \+ and \] I think 0 it 's mostly cans . E_S ###There may be bottles as well , ###but like beer cans , soda cans and what not E_S ###and they , uh , bring them up to \[ \[ a \+ one lo- , \] \+ one centralized location \] and , uh , are able *-2 to collect the money from the various beer \[ and , \+ and \] soda manufacturers \[ and , \+ uh , and \] get more money to these people that *T*-1 desperately need it . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Oh yeah . E_S ###Uh , I guess partly because of our climate . N_S ###Here in Saskatoon at least , the majority of central , uh , N_S ###well , I want *-1 to say Central Canada , E_S 
155281:43	###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###We \[ tried a way , \+ try *-1 to put \] away two and four thousand a year just for that . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Yeah .

155307:9	###SpeakerB20 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###* find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way 0 we will be able *-1 to , uh , do it *T*-2 . E_S ###You know , * kind of enforce the savings . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###But , uh , it *EXP*-1 will be interesting * to see MUMBLEx . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . 
155390:148	###SpeakerA1 . ###Anyway , uh . N_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###How about you . E_S ###What do you do *T*-1 with your budget ? E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###What do I do *T*-1 , E_S ###uh , at the moment it 's under chaos . E_S ###Uh , right now I 'm just , uh , N_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] do n't really have a budget per se . E_S 
155633:39	###and they do n't want *-1 to take the responsibility E_S ###so they will put them in a nursing home . E_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's true .

155752:118	###SpeakerA76 . ###No , E_S ###she loves it .

156763:57	###SpeakerB38 . ###but I think 0 we would make a bigger investment in kids , E_S we 'd have fewer decisions 0 * to make *T*-1 . Down the road , you know .

156805:34	###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###and if we had something 0 * to do *T*-1 before they get *-2 to be full-blown adult criminals , E_S ###and I 'm not talking about necessarily in the school system , E_S ###I 'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action .

156977:16	###\[ I did , \+ I did \] like a research kind of thing on AIDS research and stuff , E_S ###and , uh , really we 're not doing much at all , E_S ###I mean , \[ most of what *T*-1 gets raised *-2 , \+ I mean , it 's not really federal movement , ###most of what *T*-1 \[ gets raised *-2 , \+ gets raised *-3 \] \] by , uh , uh , you know , conscious , yeah , communities and things like that , you know .

157024:72	###God , E_S ###that 's a good question , Fish . E_S ###I do n't know , E_S ###uh , \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 one of the main things that *T*-1 's really important 0 * to spend money on *T*-2 is education , not support \[ or , \+ or , \] research per se , \[ but , \+ but \] education because a lot of people sort of get drummed *-3 out of the work place and out of society , you know , kind of like lepers would *?* *-4 you know E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###SpeakerA57 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . 
157036:46	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###and , uh , I think 0 that would be the most effective support 0 they could get *T*-1 is for other people \[ to understand , \+ you know , try *-2 to understand \] what they 're going through *T*-3 and everything and try *-2 to understand that \[ \[ they 're not , \+ you know , they do n't , \] \+ they do n't \] have *-4 to be just completely cut *-5 off \[ from , \+ from \] the community E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Uh-huh .

157046:26	###I guess 0 I think \[ that , \+ that , \] uh , research is , I guess the most important , just because \[ I , \+ \] you know , \[ it , \+ it \] really needs *-1 to come to an end .

157097:26	###Yeah , E_S ###\[ but , \+ but \] the other side to that is , 0 if you put him in prison for life , there 's a chance that he might do things in prison , \[ or , \+ \] you know , and somehow redeem himself .

E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Well , You know , so that , you know , N_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###SpeakerA19 . 
157109:179	###* guess 0 we killed the wrong guy . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] N_S ###yeah , E_S ###once you 've made a decision that way , it *EXP*-1 's a little difficult * to go back on it .

157121:4	###Oh , yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###it 's a- , N_S ###the benefit of the doubt to the last iota is , uh , based *-2 on the , uh , person who *T*-1 is accused *-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and , you know , \[ \[ the , \+ I , \] \+ I \] think that , you know , N_S ###and the way 0 it 's being used *-2 now *T*-1 , it 's like you listen to Bush \[ is , \+ \] you know , N_S ###well , where are we going *-2 to impose d- , you know , N_S ###it 's like for drug dealers is the new big thing like in , N_S 
157129:131	###well , where are we going *-2 to impose d- , you know , N_S ###it 's like for drug dealers is the new big thing like in , N_S ###Tsongas is also saying , you know , \[ capital , \+ * make it *EXP*-1 a capital \] crime * to be a major drug dealer . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###And , again , I do n't thing 0 these people care . E_S ###They risk their lives every day . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Yeah , E_S 
157161:54	###SpeakerB36 . ###I used *-1 to live in Georgia E_S ###and , you know , \[ the , \+ the \] big thing down there was , all right , we have capital punishment , E_S ###but if you look at who *T*-1 gets accused *-2 and who *T*-3 are the ones who *T*-4 actually get executed *-5 , it 's very racially related and ethnically related , E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Oh , yeah E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###SpeakerA39 . ###it 's \[ mainl- , \+ lot of \] blacks . E_S ###Also a lot of young people . E_S 
157169:61	###it 's \[ mainl- , \+ lot of \] blacks . E_S ###Also a lot of young people . E_S ###You know , \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ a \] sixty-two year old guy is less likely * to be put *-1 on death row from what I 've seen *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###And , you know , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 when you listen to like \[ \[ the , uh , \+ the , \] \+ the \] victims ' families and things *T*-2 , they 're always talking about , you know , uh , *-1 feeling justified or feeling , you know , like they 've gotten something out of it , E_S ###I mean , my thought has been , 0 once the guy has been imprisoned *-1 , if he goes to jail forever or whatever , if he gets killed *-2 , it should n't make any difference to \[ the , \+ uh , the \] victim 's family . E_S ###The only thing that *T*-1 should really ###, I mean , N_S obviously , if someone of mine who *T*-1 has close died , I 'd probably feel differently , E_S 
157185:27	###and that , N_S ###and , you know , also by * keeping them in prison , you do have the possibility , though , we do n't currently do this , of *-1 making restitution . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Right , E_S ###I mean , the , N_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###\[ You , \+ you \] will work your prison job E_S ###and any money 0 you earn *T*-1 will go to the victim 's family . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Right E_S 
157195:46	###and , \[ the , \+ the \] other thing is that , you know , ###I was reading through a book on , uh , \[ geneo , \+ human geneo \] research E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Uh-huh .

157377:30	###They want you to buy their car . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###there , N_S ###\[ it was , \+ it was \] interesting .

157469:20	###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , I think 0 they 're a necessary evil .

157494:84	###There 's , N_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###So , I think 0 \[ \[ for , \+ for , \] \+ for \] many years , uh , we 've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who *T*-1 are , uh , to a great extent , public servants uh , ###we have not paid them really what they 're worth *T*-2 in what they contribute *T*-3 to society .

157499:158	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###SpeakerA11 . ###I agree with that .

157630:65	###and that 's why I phrased it that way *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA6 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###Uh , in Texas , we have *-1 to meet certain state standards in order *-2 to operate \[ on a , \+ at an \] institutional level and at \[ a , \+ like a \] small home level E_S ###so you meet the standards , E_S ###but then after that \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] a lot more . E_S ###I think 0 it 's important as the safety and health and that kind of stuff , is qualification of people who *T*-1 work there , ###and in * hiring people who *T*-2 would work at \[ the , uh , day care , \+ the child care \] facility * was very difficult * to find qualified people , uh , in terms of , not \[ just , \+ just \] N_S 
161393:71	###Exactly . E_S ###And that was the most difficult thing of all , * to find \[ the , \+ the \] right people , the qualified people . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###And it *EXP*-1 's the most difficult of all for a parent , judge , uh because a person can be very nice and warm and loving , E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Oh , E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###but if he 's a space cadet and does n't watch the children , and be aware of what the safety hazards are *T*-1 , N_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Oh , exactly . E_S 
161396:51	###And it *EXP*-1 's the most difficult of all for a parent , judge , uh because a person can be very nice and warm and loving , E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Oh , E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###but if he 's a space cadet and does n't watch the children , and be aware of what the safety hazards are *T*-1 , N_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Oh , exactly . E_S ###And the other thing that *T*-1 's difficult in , uh , it 's *RNR*-2 a too small setting , like a day care center is * to find the right program of enrichment for the child , because you do n't want *-3 to just warehouse the child , E_S ###and I did n't want *-1 to run an institution where that was the case *T*-2 , where all 0 we were doing *T*-3 were warehousing *T*-4 because the first four , five years or so important E_S ###and you have *-1 to have the right kind of enrichment E_S 
161400:11	###but if he 's a space cadet and does n't watch the children , and be aware of what the safety hazards are *T*-1 , N_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Oh , exactly .

E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Maybe the right thing 0 * to do *T*-1 is * to , uh , 
161431:25	###Right , E_S ###well , you know , \[ the , \+ uh , uh , the \] world is changing \[ \[ f- , \+ uh , from instit- , \] \+ from , uh , industrial , \] uh , base to , uh , information base E_S ###and so what that means *T*-1 is 0 you do n't have *-2 to be physically powerful *-3 to work . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###SpeakerB38 . ###That 's exactly right . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###All 0 you have *-1 to do *T*-2 is * have a sharp mind , E_S 
161473:13	###SpeakerB14 . ###SpeakerA15 . ###What kind of progressive stuff ? E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh , lot of stuff that *T*-1 actually has , uh , ended up *-2 becoming popular like , uh , Nirvana and , uh , oh , you know , N_S ###I 'm thirty , E_S ###so lot of the stuff 0 I was listening to *T*-1 in my teens like the Clash \[ and , \+ and \] the Sex Pistols and R E M , that sort of stuff .

E_S ###It 's , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Yeah , E_S 
162635:38	###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Uh , but it 's on the uprise , especially in a lot of the , uh , outlying agricultural towns .

163685:155	###Well , that might be the difference . E_S ###I do n't know . E_S ###Uh , the other thing that , uh , I remember *-3 seeing *T*-1 on T V lately \[ is , \+ uh , had \] *-2 to do with , N_S ###it 's like seventy-five percent of the historical sites in America are in the home districts of very powerful people politically E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Right .

163701:131	###So , it sounds like \[ you , \+ uh , you \] think \[ that , \+ that \] we 'd be able *-1 to save some money by , uh *-2 passing the line item veto . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Oh .

E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . 
163751:11	###or you can hope that if people keep their money that they 'll spend more and create jobs \[ and , \+ and \] whatnot . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###And spare the economy .

164703:27	###SpeakerA11 . ###SpeakerB12 . ###No .

E_S ###SpeakerB1 . ###I , uh , get a lot of my news *-1 driving home from work *-2 listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED * on national public radio . E_S ###Uh , that is one of my big sources for current events information . E_S ###Uh , I really like that coverage . E_S 
164863:12	###My wife , uh , on the other hand is home most of the day E_S ###and she watches a lot of the cable news network .

165269:8	###SpeakerA46 . ###It , N_S ###uh , \[ th- , \+ they \] keep up \[ c- , \+ \] with it pretty quickly E_S ###and \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] a real good thing , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB47 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA48 . ###Uh , I do n't know .

165971:6	###And the other thing 0 we 're looking at *T*-1 is the Saturns too . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Because they looked really nice . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###But one of \[ the , \+ the \] two things that I 'm really , N_S 
165992:76	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###You set down . E_S ###You look at consumer reports . E_S ###We 've been pouring over consumer reports E_S ###and you just get so depressed for the U S auto makers when you do that *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Because you see the reliability and the types of problems 0 they have *T*-1 E_S 
166027:54	###Well , here they \[ and , \+ \] N_S ###uh , * live in an apartment complex . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###And they only have one set of recycling bins , one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters .

E_S ###Whether N_S 
166124:26	###Uh , the parents usually took out \[ time , \+ uh , you know , more time \] than they do now *-1 to come with the children and just spend the day *-2 doing a family activity .

166139:18	###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###And , uh , I do n't know , E_S ###it \[ leaves , \+ leaves \] a lot of time out for family and things like that . E_S ###In other words , they just prioritize their lives differently . E_S ###But I think 0 that has a lot 0 * to do *T*-1 with economic situation . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Yes . E_S ###What about like as far as , uh , social changes in the individual ? E_S 
166306:90	###I mean , somebody 's \[ getting , \+ getting \] a good education because we , continue *-1 to employ people . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Right .

166860:43	###\[ And , \+ and \] they say , oh , \[ we , \+ we \] know you . E_S ###You , uh , had , uh , contributed x amount last year . E_S ###Can you do better this year ? E_S ###And , you know , like * hold on here . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###How do you know that *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###\[ Who , \+ how \] do you know that *T*-1 ? E_S ###\[ Why , \+ why \] you even telling me this *T*-1 ? E_S ###Is it any of your business ? E_S 
166885:6	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###SpeakerA53 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###SpeakerA1 . ###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , Julie , uh , are you in a situation where you 'd soon need *-1 to deal with , uh , special care for elderly *T*-2 ? E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Well , I do n't know . E_S 
166921:97	###SpeakerA13 . ###But , uh , my great-grandfather was put *-1 in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###And , uh , * died six weeks after they put him in the home . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah . E_S ###And I 'm sure 0 that kind of thing would influence \[ your f- , \+ grandfather 's \] feelings . E_S ###Because , uh , \[ I th- , \+ you know , I think \] 0 for a lot of people it really is the decision of , do they still have some of their life left . E_S 
166971:48	###\[ I th- , \+ and I think \] 0 it happens more in areas where it 's , uh , I guess , uh , a broad social medical system where , uh , you know , there 's government medical care and that kind of thing *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S ###If it 's the lot where it 's funded *-1 by the individuals *T*-2 N_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] I guess 0 that 's sort of my lack of understanding . E_S ###I think that a majority of the places in the U S , uh , you know , there is some government aid available , E_S ###but the majority of it is to the availability of the individual * to pay . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###And , uh , if you 're not able *-2 to look after yourself , then you have *-1 to rely , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . 
167026:21	###So if you 're a nincompoop on trial , \[ you 'd , \+ you 'd \] have *-1 to have nincompoops 0 *T*-2 to , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . ###SpeakerB22 . ###\[ You want \+ you want \] a nincompoop jury because they 'll sympathize with you a bit as well as *-2 hopefully being honest people and do their best *-2 to comply with the facts as they were presented *-1 to them . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###SpeakerB24 . ###SpeakerA25 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . 
167030:29	###\[ You want \+ you want \] a nincompoop jury because they 'll sympathize with you a bit as well as *-2 hopefully being honest people and do their best *-2 to comply with the facts as they were presented *-1 to them . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###SpeakerB24 . ###SpeakerA25 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###So , that 's why the defense is there *-1 picking through them *T*-4 , whereas at the same time , \[ the , \+ uh , the \] prosecutor sitting there *-3 picking through them because he wants somebody who *T*-2 will give him , uh , a guilty verdict if the facts warrant . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . 
167047:50	###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###and many times I 've seen on trials 0 they have *T*-1 on T V , ###the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever , E_S ###but I think that it *EXP*-2 should be up to the judge and the , uh , lawyers * to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . 
167066:28	###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh , and I think 0 that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure . As opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure . Also , may be a more consistent sentencing procedure . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Well , I suppose 0 you may be right on that . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###SpeakerA43 . ###Matter of fact , \[ I 've heard that , \+ I 've heard that \] some of the information *ICH*-2 , uh , is prevented *-1 from *-1 reaching the jury , like , uh , mitigating circumstances \[ or , \+ or \] preceding , uh , criminal record or things of this nature that , N_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . ###SpeakerB46 . 
167161:13	###and states \[ c- , \+ can \] use all the revenue 0 they can get *T*-1 . E_S ###\[ With some , \+ with something \] like that , \[ d- , \+ do \] your arguments still apply ? E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###Well , I think that \[ if , \+ if \] policy is established *-1 *RNR*-3 and if a mechanism is put *-2 into place *RNR*-3 * to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion , then I do n't argue with it . E_S ###Because it *EXP*-1 's not a burden on the consumer * to remember that oh , I bought this out of state . E_S ###I need *-1 to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania . E_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###Which *T*-1 is exactly what businesses do *T*-2 at the present . E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###Right . E_S 
167197:36	###My \[ a- , \+ accounting \] department will at the end of the month . E_S ###\[ I think that \[ i- , \+ i- , \] \+ I think 0 that 's \] the way 0 things work in Pennsylvania *T*-1 . E_S ###And I know 0 they work that way \[ in , \+ uh , say here in \] D C . E_S ###SpeakerB25 . ###Yeah . E_S ###See I 'm unfamiliar with that because \[ I do n't , \+ I never see \] that end of the business . E_S ###SpeakerA26 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###So , my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer . E_S 
167264:27	###SpeakerA19 . ###Of course , you have *-1 to also put value on the criminal . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###So if you terminate him , that 's a loss of value . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Well , that 's true . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###So , you know , if you weight everyone equally , then you have *-1 to say , well the likelihood of * not terminating him , N_S 
167264:50	###SpeakerA19 . ###Of course , you have *-1 to also put value on the criminal . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###So if you terminate him , that 's a loss of value . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Well , that 's true . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###So , you know , if you weight everyone equally , then you have *-1 to say , well the likelihood of * not terminating him , N_S 
167274:12	###if you do n't terminate him , the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person . E_S ###In other words , \[ you 'd have * to , \+ you 'd have *-2 to \] murder more than one other person uh , in order * to justify * taking his life . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Besides him . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###SpeakerB26 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Another way 0 you could do it *T*-1 is * weight this value by , uh , the value to society of the people . Uh , which *T*-2 is pretty delicate thing 0 * to do *T*-3 . E_S ###But one way of * doing it is , uh , by income . E_S 
167278:6	###SpeakerA25 . ###SpeakerB26 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Another way 0 you could do it *T*-1 is * weight this value by , uh , the value to society of the people . Uh , which *T*-2 is pretty delicate thing 0 * to do *T*-3 . E_S ###But one way of * doing it is , uh , by income . E_S ###So if this guy does n't make a great deal of money , which *T*-1 is often times the case , \[ then \+ then \] he 's obviously not worth very much E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . 
167308:25	###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###uh , I know 0 I have a friend whose , uh , son *T*-1 was murdered *-2 , uh , on the night before his sixteenth birthday . E_S ###And * let me tell you , uh , \[ I , \+ I \] knew them personally , uh , not intimately , but quite well E_S ###and , uh , you 're talking about real trauma . I mean trauma that *T*-1 extends beyond the counting of bodies . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###I can imagine . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###The father , you know , N_S 
167399:8	###SpeakerA24 . ###well in Massachusetts , I thought 0 I was going *-1 to , N_S ###well , it was \[ a , \+ a \] fun time E_S ###but I thought , gosh , summer time , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB25 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA26 . ###Well , all 0 it ever did *T*-1 was rain and thunder storms . E_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###SpeakerA28 . 
167518:27	###My parents do not have a whole lot of money 0 * to put *T*-2 into it . E_S ###SpeakerA70 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB71 . ###And , uh , but it , N_S ###see in a lot of the windows ? E_S ###SpeakerA72 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB73 . 
167582:28	###I , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Kathy ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Do you , N_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###So , what is your , uh , family , N_S ###what do you usually do *T*-1 as far as budgeting ? E_S ###SpeakerB4 . 
167611:6	###SpeakerB12 . ###\[ And , \+ uh , and \] we 're continually putting into those , you know , each month how much we 're going *-1 to need *T*-2 E_S ###and then we know the month that we 're going *-1 to have enough * to get that particular item *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###So we very rarely buy anything on credit . E_S ###Everything 0 we buy *T*-1 is paid for *-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Yeah . E_S 
167617:74	###So we very rarely buy anything on credit . E_S ###Everything 0 we buy *T*-1 is paid for *-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Yeah . E_S ###My husband is a finance major also . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###SpeakerA17 . ###And , uh , we kind of have the same plan . E_S ###Uh , we have one credit card E_S ###and every month we put , uh , you know , the same amount in for retirement . E_S 
167667:6	###SpeakerA37 . ###Oh , I see . E_S ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###And so it 's actually pulled *-1 out . E_S ###Then we keep our N_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Oh , I see . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###we have a savings account for the kids ' education . E_S 
167713:71	###so what *T*-1 goes into \[ that , \+ that \] particular thing ? E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###SpeakerA55 . ###It 's vacations , Christmas . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Christmas , birthdays , uh , car maintenance , dental , medical , E_S ###we just averaged out how much *ICH*-3 last year we used *T*-1 per month on medical and how much we used *T*-2 on dental E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . 
167721:119	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###\[ and , \+ uh , and so \] now when we have *-1 to come up with that deductible that our insurance does n't cover *T*-2 *T*-4 rather than * wondering where it 's going *-5 to come from *T*-3 , E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###we have it , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . 
167791:26	###We have a clothing , uh , envelope for each of the kids and for myself and my husband that we put how much we figure 0 we need *T*-1 each month on clothing *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###It really works out great . E_S ###We 're finding that we have a lot more money 0 *-1 to spend *T*-2 on things like that . E_S ###And we 're , N_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ What , \+ what , \] N_S 
167840:71	###SpeakerB10 . ###And I , N_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###I got a friend who *T*-1 goes there , by the way . E_S ###I want *-1 to \[ as- , \+ talk \] to you about that afterward , E_S ###okay . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Okay . E_S ###Uh , I 've , N_S ###the high school 0 I went to *T*-1 \[ was , \+ uh , was \] a good one also . E_S 
167853:41	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###SpeakerA15 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ It was \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ it 's a \] more or less a suburban school system ? E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yes . E_S ###\[ That , \+ that \] was true for mine too . E_S 
167872:58	###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's true . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###I mean you know . N_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah . E_S ###And I 'm also N_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###SpeakerB26 . 
167915:62	###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###So I guess 0 \[ I ca n't really \+ I ca n't \] say what it *EXP*-2 would be like *T*-1 * to , uh , grow up in a really oppressed region . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . 
167923:25	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###You know , I guess 0 \[ the whole , \+ the whole \] environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the MUMBLEx people . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah . E_S ###And I think 0 that 's almost a bigger factor , than anything else probably . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###SpeakerA49 . ###I mean , \[ I do n't , \+ I think \] you know , 0 people just , N_S ###SpeakerB50 . 
167996:48	###Then in high school it changed into four levels \[ of , \+ uh , of \] instruction in the major subjects . Uh , which , N_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###I mean , actually I think 0 that works pretty well . E_S ###MUMBLEx and \[ that , \+ that \] makes , N_S ###SpeakerB1 . ###MUMBLEx . ###SpeakerA2 . ###Well , here in Logan , Utah , we 've got a nice little valley here E_S 
168002:13	###SpeakerB1 . ###MUMBLEx . ###SpeakerA2 . ###Well , here in Logan , Utah , we 've got a nice little valley here E_S ###and it 's like crystal clear all the time except for during the winter when the inversion sets in *T*-1 E_S ###and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley . E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Huh . E_S ###Well , here in Seattle , uh , \[ it 's g- , \+ the air 's getting \] more and more polluted . E_S ###\[ We 're , \+ uh , we 're \] in kind of a basin . E_S 
168051:25	###They 're getting serious about things like , uh , mandatory , N_S ###well they 've already passed laws where you have *-1 to get your cars checked *-3 for pollution if you 're in certain counties *T*-2 , E_S ###emissions . N_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###MUMBLEx have they started *-1 doing that yet ? E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###Yeah . E_S ###They 've actually started *-1 doing it down along the , N_S ###not in Logan up here cause we 're doing a lot better . E_S 
168054:75	###SpeakerB19 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###MUMBLEx have they started *-1 doing that yet ? E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###Yeah .

168082:15	###You mean 0 they could do that remotely ? E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB29 . ###SpeakerA30 . ###Yeah . E_S ###* Do it remotely *-2 just looking at \[ the , \+ \] ###what they do *T*-1 , E_S they do several different types of things .

168133:5	###SpeakerA46 . ###Yeah . E_S ###And they 're ...

168323:27	###Oh , you can actually rent those ? E_S ###SpeakerA74 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB75 . ###Okay . E_S ###That 's interesting . E_S ###Yeah E_S ###SpeakerA76 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB77 .

168640:33	###SpeakerA41 . ###No , E_S ###you ca n't , N_S ###they do n't execute anybody in Britain or France E_S ###and I do n't believe 0 they do in Germany or Italy either E_S ###and they do n't have the crime problems 0 we do *T*-1 . E_S ###I do n't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . 
168782:23	###Uh , so , you know , I do n't know , E_S ###I take advantage , N_S ###I do n't have a great deal of time 0 *-2 to spend *T*-1 with the kids , E_S ###but I take advantage of , um , dinner time . E_S ###We always eat together E_S ###and , you know , whenever you 're with your kids *T*-2 , you want *-1 to interact with them rather than just ignore them . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Do you keep your kids , uh , active in sports or anything E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerA25 .

168788:18	###SpeakerB24 . ###Do you keep your kids , uh , active in sports or anything E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Uh , I guess 0 our big outlet is music . ###Uh E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###our thirteen year old son plays violin E_S 
168798:68	###and our , nine year old daughter plays cello E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###Okay .

E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###SpeakerA33 . 
168806:69	###SpeakerB32 . ###SpeakerA33 . ###So there 's \[ plenty of , \+ plenty of \] interactive time in , uh , * practicing . Although neither kid likes *-1 to practice .

168815:19	###SpeakerA37 . ###But \[ I mea- , \+ I imagine \] 0 with infants \[ you are , \+ \] most of your time is sort of spent *-1 * taking care of them rather than interacting with them .

E_S ###I think 0 they should be evaluated *-1 that way rather than with \[ a , \+ you know , a \] chemical , you know , E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Well , what about this , uh , AIDS epidemic now ? E_S Where you find that , uh , uh , you know , certain people \[ are \+ actually \[ are , \+ are \] \] criminal in their disregard for \[ it- , \+ others *T*-1 . \] E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###These people that *T*-1 are carriers and \[ do n't \+ that *T*-2 do n't \] reveal it ? E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah , E_S 
169011:41	###SpeakerA43 . ###But , again , * to require , you know , such a test \[ and jus- , \+ and then \] to \[ make , \+ make \] it MUMBLEx is * to subject them \[ to , \+ to \] \[ discrimi- , \+ discriminatory \] practices and other things . E_S ###I do n't know , E_S ###uh , I do n't know how exactly I feel about that *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Maybe chop their weenies off . E_S ###SpeakerB1 . ###Okay . E_S ###* Go ahead . E_S ###SpeakerA2 . 
169020:39	###SpeakerA2 . ###Uh , well , you know , uh , I think 0 public service is a worthy thing E_S ###and as a matter of fact there are a lot of programs , uh , such as Peace Corps that *T*-1 promote that . E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###Probably the most popular one but , uh , one that *T*-1 is not typically recognized *-2 as such is the Boy Scouts . E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA6 . 
169025:47	###SpeakerA4 . ###Probably the most popular one but , uh , one that *T*-1 is not typically recognized *-2 as such is the Boy Scouts . E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###Huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA8 . 
169043:24	###and , of course , \[ Pe- , \+ the Peace \] Corps , the Boy Scouts \[ is a , o- , \+ is a \] voluntary activity . E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerB15 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 that might be \[ talking , \+ referring \] to , uh , something , kind of , uh , alternative to the draft , you know . E_S ###Either you have , uh , military service or some sort of alternative , nonmilitary service for a few years . E_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###Right , E_S 
169048:91	###SpeakerB15 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 that might be \[ talking , \+ referring \] to , uh , something , kind of , uh , alternative to the draft , you know .

169105:19	###SpeakerA34 . ###Why ? E_S ###SpeakerB35 . ###And I went to college for four years and got out , you know , E_S ###SpeakerA36 . ###Why is that *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###\[ so . \+ But , \] uh , you know , for some people that 's good . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] do n't particular like the fact that it 's the military , you know , E_S ###MUMBLEx 
169133:14	###and , well , \[ \[ it 's , \+ it , \] \+ it \] seems pretty \[ aggre- , \+ aggressive \] oriented , E_S ###I mean , \[ you , \+ you \] look at the last \[ mis- , \+ military \] action which *T*-1 was in the Persian Gulf and was n't anywhere near the United States E_S ###and \[ it was , \+ uh , you know , it was \] definitely a projection of U S power on the other side of the globe , E_S ###so , \[ at , \+ at \] any rate , this is getting off the topic E_S ###but i- , N_S ###\[ my , \+ my \] point was that \[ there is , \+ for people who *T*-1 do n't want *-2 to do the military service , \[ there , \+ it would be neat if there \] were \] an alternative that *T*-4 could instill the same sort of personal discipline and sense of purpose and , uh , sense of community that the Boy Scouts , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###So , um , how do you feel about the crime in your city *T*-1 ? E_S ###Is it , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB2 . 
169148:30	###Uh , that *ICH*-1 's kind of gone up in scale \[ and , \+ and \] some other things . E_S ###Uh , I personally had a little experience the other day . E_S ###Uh , somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Oh , really . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###But , actually , you know , when you look \[ at , \+ at \] Minneapolis as compared to where I used *-1 to live *T*-2 *T*-3 , it 's really quite a bit better .

169210:32	###Uh , but in Orlando , before I moved up , we had a real problem with it . E_S ###Uh , we 've been broken into *-1 in my apartment about four times in like two and a half weeks .

E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh , because they were just , N_S 
169221:51	###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###and then the houses were left *-1 unguarded *-2 , ###uh , E_S but yeah , E_S ###I think 0 given that people are pretty conscientious about it , N_S that 's a good way 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] work it *T*-1 , with a neighborhood watch .

169331:37	###SpeakerB76 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###uh , you can do that which *T*-3 is what I choose *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Yeah . E_S ###One of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . 
169408:39	###but \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I 've \] never read a newspaper in my entire life E_S ###and \[ \[ I 've , \+ I , \] \+ I \] never watch T V news nor listen to the news on the radio unless I 'm just happening *-1 to be listening to music and they slip it on in the car radio before I can turn it off .

169451:20	###And the view that I would rather take *T*-1 is that there 's a different amount of information 0 you need *T*-2 when you 're particularly interested in a topic or , uh , particularly interested in *-7 buying something \[ as a , \+ you know as a \] hobbyist *T*-5 versus when you want *-3 to go out and buy a blender because you need *-4 to mix things *T*-6 .

E_S ###If you want *-1 to just have an idea as to what *T*-2 's going on , most papers , \[ a- , \+ and \] especially the better papers , \[ the , \+ the \] TIMES , the WALL STREET JOURNAL , the WASHINGTON POST give you a reasonable idea .

169577:27	###SpeakerB10 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###And * seems to me that \[ that 's , \+ I think 0 that 's \] the way 0 it 's done *-1 now *T*-2 .

169656:8	###it 's not able *-1 to fit in , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Something inexpensive . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###exactly . E_S ###Uh , I guess , kind of 0 the way 0 I think about it *T*-1 also , is 0 they just , N_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###SpeakerB48 . 
169741:13	###SpeakerA79 . ###Maybe they could go \[ with a , \+ with a \] nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their , uh , vote . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ that 's , \+ that 's \] been so long 0 I 've \[ prac- , \+ practically \] forgot who Noriega was *T*-1 , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###Right .

169851:18	###I have real mixed feelings about it . E_S ###I do n't know . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###\[ How , \+ do you know how \] wrong they are *T*-1 ?

169865:38	###And if you could show that , N_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] interviewed for a job recently E_S ###and I was taking Entex . ###And my doctor gave me a prescription for it .

169978:39	###Uh , but , uh , some friends of mine have , uh , gone through this .

170348:4	###I think 0 the company still exists . E_S ###What they use *-1 to do *T*-2 is , they used *-3 to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to *-4 just laying people off you know . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###That way that , you know , one person would n't get one big blunt blow at one time . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###And , uh , you know , I think 0 if they had programs that *T*-1 set up *-2 to subsidize people that *T*-3 do get laid *-4 off a little bit better , you know , other than \[ s- , \+ you know , something \] like , N_S 
170465:12	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###but it *EXP*-1 's hard * to raise one child without them thinking 0 \[ they 're the , \+ they 're the \] pivot point of the universe .

E_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA20 .

E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . 
171368:21	###SpeakerA17 . ###I think 0 maybe \[ th- , \+ a \] judge is a better judge of that E_S ###or , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Well , \[ s- , \+ sometimes \] the sentencing \[ is still , \+ is not \] fair .

E_S 
171379:74	###uh , E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . ###Well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom , I trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone 's guilty or innocent . E_S ###That 's usually a matter of who * to believe *T*-2 and what facts * to believe *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . 
171392:137	###SpeakerA25 . ###In Texas here , people tend *-1 to get whipped *-2 up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh , it 's kind of , uh , uh , a hanging jury atmosphere . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###But in a lot of places , I think 0 people bend over the other way , E_S 
171406:10	###SpeakerA31 . ###I kind of like that system . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] not a bad system . E_S ###But \[ I , \+ I \] do think 0 it needs *-1 to be shaken *-2 up a little bit . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . 
171484:6	###And I 'm not convinced *-1 that any of them work a hundred percent . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh , the one 0 I have *T*-1 now is okay , most of the time . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###But that 's it . E_S ###But \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] probably the worst . E_S 
171557:4	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###but I just felt like , well at least I did something . E_S ###Maybe they 'll fix it . E_S ###They might work on that , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###But I find 0 attitudes are more of a problem . E_S 
171585:9	###I guess 0 \[ \[ if , \+ if \] you call \[ the e- , \+ any eight \] hundred number , \+ uh , if , \[ you , \+ you \] can call up \[ e- , \+ any eight \] hundred number \] directory assistance , \[ and \+ \] you can get , uh , the eight hundred number of the customer service support line for a number of companies .

173832:22	###So you 're saying that the taxpayer who *T*-1 also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of , uh , real estate or other taxes E_S ###\[ and , \+ and , \] consequently , they 're not so motivated *-1 to get involved *-2 and make * sure 0 things happen the way 0 they 'd like *-3 to see them happen *T*-4 ?

176538:6	###SpeakerB57 . ###And so , uh , we did n't take her over there until like about eleven o'clock .

E_S ###I mean , I 'm not *?* , E_S 
176612:6	###SpeakerB3 . ###Uh , no . E_S ###I mean , I 'm not *?* , E_S ###my employer does not do that .

176634:68	###SpeakerA10 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###Uh , so . N_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ \[ It , \+ uh , that 's , \] \+ that 's \] mine . E_S ###\[ It , \+ it , \] you know , N_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] go back , E_S

177020:288	###Yeah , E_S ###my current project is a walkway which I 'm building *T*-1 *ICH*-2 around the house and out to the backyard \[ to , \+ \] uh , you know , *-3 digging it out and laying sand and putting , uh , pavers on top of that E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###That 's a lot easier . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###You 've got something going all the time . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . 
177058:31	###SpeakerA13 . ###and they did n't get beat *-1 up . You know . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###No . E_S ###It , N_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Rodney got beat *-1 up because \[ \[ \[ he , \+ he , \] \+ you know , he pur- , \] \+ you know , he involved \] himself in some \[ sub , \+ self-destructive \] behavior .

177129:22	###\[ \[ And \+ and so \] I , \+ but \[ I , \+ I \] \] suspect a number of them . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Um .

177188:81	###And so this is my seventh call . E_S ###A year ago I did eleven calls . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Oh , I see . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###And so \[ \[ that 's , \+ that 's why , \] \+ uh , uh , that 's why \] I 'm religiously getting on the phone *T*-1 because \[ I have a unique , \+ you know , I have a unique \] situation here in that if I do n't participate , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###And you say 0 you have some strong feelings about , uh , the issue ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Uh , yes E_S 
177224:60	###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###And , of course , I 'm not perfectly happy about *-1 not having a job . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###So , how do you feel *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Well , I 'm a little bit ambivalent . E_S

E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Well , I 'm a little bit ambivalent . E_S ###\[ The problem with , \+ uh , and I think 0 one of the problems with \] immigration policy is like any other political problem is that people are not willing *-1 to discuss it , uh , \[ in , \+ in \] terms of what , uh , *T*-2 really is driving it . E_S ###They 're not willing *-1 to tell the truth . The same way with , uh , issues of , uh , race and things like that . E_S 
177247:15	###At the bottom end , they , uh , are always willing *-1 to , uh , let in cheap labor if it lowers the cost of * doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the , powerful people in that area . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . ###SpeakerB22 . ###SpeakerA23 . ###Those are two things that I think 0 *T*-1 are going on .

177338:20	###SpeakerA4 . ###SpeakerB5 . ###But I gather 0 you do not separate , uh , the bottles and cans . E_S ###SpeakerA6 . ###No , E_S ###\[ they , \+ they \] do that on the truck .

177353:49	###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA10 . ###You must have come to Washington at least once . E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###Yes , E_S ###I know .

177360:65	###That is we also have blue bins . E_S ###We also separate newspapers from all of the other stuff which *T*-1 goes into the bin and gets separated *-2 in the truck ###and , uh , landfill space is , in deed , the driving factor here .
