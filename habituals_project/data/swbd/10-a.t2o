937:99	###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###yeah .

1033:68	###\[ \[ and , \+ you know , and , \] \+ and \] that hacker just has *-1 to get \[ in to , \+ in touch \] with the sneak thief E_S ###and suddenly \[ and then \+ \] what *T*-1 started as an invasion of privacy can be an invasion of your actual home . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###And I guess 0 that turns out *-1 to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you 're feeling , threatened as a result \[ of , \+ of \] it E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###so , maybe that is \[ a , \+ a \] little bit of what privacy is *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . 
1038:56	###SpeakerA67 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###so , maybe that is \[ a , \+ a \] little bit of what privacy is *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Yes . E_S ###Exactly . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###SpeakerA71 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
1042:48	###SpeakerA69 . ###Yes . E_S ###Exactly . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###SpeakerA71 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###I also thought about it , \[ was of , \+ \] uh , *-1 waiting *-2 to talk to you that , another thing that *T*-4 occurred to me is 0 there is not so much invasion of my privacy because I know how *-5 to behave *T*-6 such that there is n't *?* . E_S ###But I realized 0 I have *-1 to behave in a certain way in order *-2 to not have people invade my privacy . E_S ###If I deviate from social norms of behavior , if I run up and down the street *-1 yelling or something , someone 's going *-2 to invade my privacy very quickly . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . 
1059:36	###certainly the language 0 I know *T*-1 does n't , but just says a word for loneliness . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Oh , that 's interesting . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Loneliness *ICH*-2 is the closest 0 you can come *T*-1 , which *T*-3 is really quite different . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###\[ But , \+ but \] no concept for * wanting *-1 to be private . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ It 's , \+ it 's \] generally 0 * being alone is not a very desirable state , at least officially . E_S 
1095:20	###Um , people start *-1 paying attention to you very much E_S ###and they start *-1 asking questions and in the sense are \[ \[ invite- , \+ invade , \] \+ invading \] your privacy although , if you know what the social norms are *T*-2 , you know , quote unquote , you asked for it . E_S ###But it does mean that you have yet another reason 0 *-1 to follow a set of social norms *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###\[ And \+ \] which *T*-1 is n't \[ of , \+ \] always the case in all cultures , E_S ###and it was n't until I was thinking about it just now that I realized 0 that 's actually something that *T*-1 's culturally relative . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###\[ Tha- , \+ that \] is true . E_S 
1117:68	###Um , but \[ I , \+ I \] just do n't quite , um , N_S ###there 's hope , ###I actually ###for al- , N_S of the time 0 I 've spent *T*-1 there , I still do n't quite understand how certain things that I assume 0 *T*-2 and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###Because anyone can be alone for some period of time E_S ###but for me a lot of what I do *T*-1 requires a sense that there 's this invisible barrier around me which people \[ wil- , \+ will \] respect *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB96 . 
1144:8	###So that is more of a sense of invasion . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###So , that 's another example of the invasion because of the not so ... N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Have you ever gotten one of those calls that *T*-1 is either generated *-2 by a computer or somebody going down a list E_S ###and they 're either offering a service E_S ###or they 're introducing some new product in the area E_S ###and normally when they call *T*-1 , you 're either in the shower , E_S ###or you 're in the middle of * cooking something E_S ###and you have *-1 to stop everything *-2 to run to the phone . E_S 
1162:53	###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###And you are trying *-1 to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone , E_S ###\[ you either hear , the cli- , \+ as soon as you say hello , you hear the click \] of the recording coming on , E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###or you hear somebody all ready starting , reading off a list of stuff that they 've read *T*-1 probably a thousand times that day already . E_S 
1261:35	###I 've even gone so far as *-1 to put that , N_S ###I 've got a storm door on the front of the house E_S ###and I 've put , in , N_S ###I do n't know how much clearer it can be *T*-1 , E_S ###it 's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting . E_S ###\[ I should have , \+ I guess 0 I should make \] another one that *T*-1 says religious or otherwise , cause I still get , N_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###that 's true , E_S 
1586:21	###that would be wonderful . E_S ###SpeakerA92 . ###Yes , E_S ###oh , I do too . E_S ###SpeakerB93 . ###Plus , I bet 0 it \[ cuts , \+ cuts \] down on your absenteeism because you 've got two days off that you can do everything *T*-1 , E_S ###so you do n't have *-1 to *?* , you know , unless you 're just really sick , or the child 's sick . E_S ###SpeakerA94 . ###Most of the time now , you know , it 's just the weekend , E_S ###or * just forget it . E_S 
1823:100	###but , N_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I do n't know E_S ###\[ it may have , \+ it may have \] been somebody else , because \[ I think , \+ I think \] that even Jimi Hendrix did it , E_S ###I think 0 that was a cov- , N_S ###you know , * come *-1 to think of it , I think 0 that was a cover version of , like a John Lee Hooker song , or something , E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Maybe so . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I , \] ca n't think . E_S 
1967:11	###\[ a lot of the , \+ a lot of \] \[ where they , \+ where they \] make music that they adapt *T*-1 \[ \[ to a , \+ to another kind of , \] \+ to another type of \] listener *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB110 . ###Uh , for example , * let 's say 0 you 're taking like an original Brazilian form of music \[ and , \+ \] with a certain style , E_S ###and then you try *-1 to make it a little bit more listenable for , * let 's say *RNR*-2 another audience , * let 's say *RNR*-3 a North American . E_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB112 . ###And , then when they hear it *T*-1 , \[ \[ it , \+ it 's a really , \] \+ it 's \] another form of music , 
1995:6	###\[ and then , \+ and then \] * taking \[ those , \+ those \] qualities , and then applying , in the styles , \[ that *T*-1 are really , \+ um , that *T*-2 are \] extremely enjoyable , and then taking , N_S ###SpeakerA119 . ###So then it becomes a kind of music \[ of , \+ of \] its own , so * to speak , E_S ###or , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB120 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###it becomes a kind of music of its own . E_S ###I mean , when you listen to it *T*-1 , it 's um , uh , N_S ###I think that they do n't use , elec- , N_S 
2069:11	###that 's \[ our , \+ our \] biggest , uh , expense E_S ###so I take half of that amount out of my checkbook \[ each , \+ with each \] paycheck , even thought it 's really still there , so that I can keep , uh , uh , good balance , a running total , yeah through the month , E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###SpeakerB8 . ###A running total . E_S 
2114:33	###and some- , an unexpected comes up , then \[ you 're not , \+ you know , you do n't \] feel it so strapped . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###You do n't have *-1 to go out and borrow it somewhere and do that . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Right , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###because \[ we do n't , \+ you know , we do n't \] charge anything that we ca n't pay *T*-1 off by the end of the month .

2215:74	###that 's \[ a , \+ a \] big thing 0 * to think about *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Right , E_S ###yeah , you know , E_S ###if , I would sell the , you know , N_S ###if , \[ he , \+ \] something would happen to him , I would n't stay in Texas , E_S ###I would , uh , sell the house and move back home , you know , to my home town , E_S ###\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , I would n't stay here in Texas , E_S ###so you know , I do n't know what he would do *T*-1 .

2511:31	###and \[ he , sho- , \+ he \] knew who *T*-1 worked there , E_S ###he should have realized that we were n't regulars in the warehouse there .

4750:4	###SpeakerB26 . ###Well , I formulated a pretty radical theory over the last ten years , I guess 0 *T*-1 .

6991:6	###but , uh , I take the checkbook E_S ###so \[ \[ I , \+ you know , I , \] just , \+ if I need cash , I just \] tell him E_S ###and he gets it out E_S ###and I do n't even think 0 I know my number . E_S ###SpeakerA40 . ###Well , I find it a great use from the standpoint that you do n't have *-1 to continue *-2 to write checks , in order *-3 to get cash . E_S ###SpeakerB41 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA42 . ###SpeakerB43 . 
7033:6	###SpeakerB59 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA60 . ###And , uh , during that whole month and , then * pay it at the end of the month . E_S ###SpeakerB61 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA62 . ###SpeakerB63 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I mean , \[ I get , \+ I get \] at least one or two a week . People , \[ t- , \+ \] you know , sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone 
7069:14	###SpeakerA76 . ###I think so , ###you 're right . E_S ###SpeakerB77 . ###So , N_S ###SpeakerA78 . ###Well , it *EXP*-1 's interesting , uh , that , uh , people have \[ the , \+ generally the \] same view . of credit cards , no matter where you go *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB79 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA80 . 
7117:46	###so , well , N_S ###SpeakerA100 . ###Right . E_S ###Well * take good care . E_S ###* Take care of your little ones . E_S ###SpeakerB101 . ###\[ You , \+ you \] too . E_S ###Good luck . E_S ###SpeakerA102 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
7135:17	###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , uh , the hobbies that I pursue *T*-1 in my spare time , are crafts E_S ###and , uh , I 've been involved in * making , uh , hat stands and , uh , rag dolls and , uh , different type hats with , uh , flowers and roses , you know , and , uh , that kind of thing , straw hats and , all that kind of stuff . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###And I enjoy it , E_S ###it 's relaxing . E_S ###And you kind of get absorbed in it E_S ###so the time goes by , you know , before you realize 0 anything is going on . E_S 
7145:8	###And I play the organ sometimes , uh , just for my own satisfaction . Not for anybody else 's ears E_S ###because I 'm not that good at it , E_S ###but I like *-1 to bang on the keyboards once in a while . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Oh really ? E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###How about yourself ? E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Well , oh , hobbies , gee whiz , E_S ###I guess 0 I got too many hobbies E_S 
7192:6	###but that 's the way 0 life is *T*-2 , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###That 's the hard part , right ? E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Exactly . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###If you can do things together , that really helps a lot . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###MUMBLEx yeah , E_S ###we , uh , N_S 
7193:24	###SpeakerB18 . ###That 's the hard part , right ? E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Exactly . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###If you can do things together , that really helps a lot . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###MUMBLEx yeah , E_S ###we , uh , N_S ###she 's , uh , into aerobics , E_S 
7498:50	###SpeakerA22 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] true . E_S ###I think 0 in , uh , the Texas governor elections , I think more people turned out *-1 to vote against somebody than for somebody , this time . E_S ###SpeakerB23 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , that , uh , N_S ###MUMBLEx I know that there 's certain issues that *T*-1 can really motivate people because we live in a \[ \[ pr- , \+ pr- , \] \+ predominately \] Catholic type area , E_S ###SpeakerA24 . ###Oh , really ? E_S 
7511:25	###SpeakerA26 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###and , uh , still on the other hand we 're also , uh , N_S ###this particular community is a Catholic community E_S ###but , uh , uh , down in D C \[ where , \+ where \] things are a little bit different *T*-1 , uh , you know , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] women 's rights \[ and \+ \[ the , \+ \] and \] that sort of movement , E_S ###and so it 's , uh , quite the opposite , E_S ###so elections start *-1 getting very , uh , N_S ###the elections where they have that topic *T*-2 seem *-1 to be a little bit better *ICH*-3 attended than some of the other ones . E_S ###SpeakerA28 . 
7516:8	###but , uh , uh , down in D C \[ where , \+ where \] things are a little bit different *T*-1 , uh , you know , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] women 's rights \[ and \+ \[ the , \+ \] and \] that sort of movement , E_S ###and so it 's , uh , quite the opposite , E_S ###so elections start *-1 getting very , uh , N_S ###the elections where they have that topic *T*-2 seem *-1 to be a little bit better *ICH*-3 attended than some of the other ones . E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's true . E_S ###SpeakerB29 . ###But , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA30 . 
7531:68	###SpeakerA32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB33 . ###and , uh , it *EXP*-4 does n't matter who they put *T*-3 in office , they 're going *-1 to fall subject to , uh , the pressure that the lobbyists can put *T*-2 , E_S ###SpeakerA34 . ###Right . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###and it *EXP*-3 's , uh , real true that , uh , you know , they 'll say one thing , *-1 to get elected * , E_S ###SpeakerB35 . ###SpeakerA36 . 
7588:22	###SpeakerA54 . ###Right , E_S ###that 's , N_S you know , ###neither has mine *?* as a matter of fact . E_S ###And , uh , , that 's true , E_S ###\[ they , \+ I think 0 they \] look at it as , well everybody , the majority of the people think this way , when that 's not necessarily true *T*-2 , because , you know , that 's what the media says *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB55 . ###SpeakerA56 . ###Well , the majority believes this way E_S ###so , uh , they do n't even bother *-1 turning out *-2 to vote to express their , uh , opinions . E_S 
7597:11	###so , uh , they do n't even bother *-1 turning out *-2 to vote to express their , uh , opinions . E_S ###So \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] true . E_S ###SpeakerB57 . ###Yeah , E_S ###* wonder if they 're going *-1 to take into account MUMBLEx this computerized conversation that there 's little children , you know , bouncing in your knee , the whole time 0 you 're talking *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA58 . ###SpeakerB59 . ###SpeakerA60 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Do you hear the dogs in the background here ? E_S 
7682:8	###SpeakerB87 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA88 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I still have n't figured out what the zero through six days which day *T*-1 is which yet E_S ###but , I did n't study it that hard E_S ###SpeakerB89 . ###SpeakerA90 . ###so maybe I 'll figure it out . E_S ###SpeakerB91 . 
7983:14	###and you do n't know what they 're there for *T*-1 , you know , when they 're coming *T*-2 , how long they 're going *-3 to be *T*-4 , E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###Yeah , E_S ###oh , how funny . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###you know , it 's just MUMBLEx 0 there they are *T*-1 E_S ###and they 're writing the whole time . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###No communication whatsoever . E_S ###SpeakerA99 . 
8062:23	###SpeakerB130 . ###Oh , God . E_S ###SpeakerA131 . ###And so I go , okay ###, I mean , you just , \[ you \+ \] did , what you wanted *-1 to do *T*-2 , E_S ###SpeakerB132 . ###How funny . E_S ###SpeakerA133 . ###and now they tell you what * to teach *T*-2 and how long and , you know , what day , what period . E_S ###SpeakerB134 . 
8351:19	###but , in fact , he 's in electronics , E_S ###but he knew 0 the only way 0 we 'd ever have a new home *T*-1 is if he would build it . E_S ###So it took him about two and a half years , E_S ###but , uh , he built us a house , E_S ###it 's , uh , N_S ###we have thirty-two hundred square feet , E_S ###and it 's a brick house , E_S ###and price-wise , it was great because he did it all himself , you know , E_S ###so that way \[ he could , \+ we could \] kind of \[ control , in , \+ control it , \] E_S ###SpeakerB4 . 
8425:6	###SpeakerA23 . ###Yes , E_S ###yes . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###We 're having \[ a , \+ an \] architect friend of mine design a house for us E_S ###and that can basically \[ be , \+ be \] put \[ on any lot , \+ in any state , \] \[ any kin- , \+ \] you know , E_S ###so that 's kind of , 0 we just got with him and told him what all we wanted *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . 
8504:160	###but he controls that part E_S ###but , then whenever , you know , N_S ###it 's like , once the semester starts I 'm the one who *T*-1 has *-2 to control how much spending there is *T*-3 . E_S ###And the only thing that \[ I , \+ I \] basically spend my money on *T*-1 is just food E_S ###\[ and , \+ um , so , \] N_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###What about tuition and rent ? E_S ###Who *T*-1 takes care of that ? E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Well , the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that I live in a dorm . E_S 
8507:22	###And the only thing that \[ I , \+ I \] basically spend my money on *T*-1 is just food E_S ###\[ and , \+ um , so , \] N_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###What about tuition and rent ? E_S ###Who *T*-1 takes care of that ? E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Well , the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that I live in a dorm . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . 
8518:63	###SpeakerB6 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###And then the tuition is also the same thing . E_S ###So , the thing \[ is , \+ is \] basically that I spend , like , maybe thirty-five , forty dollars every two weeks \[ on , \+ on \] groceries E_S ###and that 's about it . E_S ###But the thing , uh , also is that , you know , like if you want *-1 to go out like if you want *-2 to go to a restaurant or something , then I have *-3 to moderate that because it 's like I ca n't go *-4 eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars , um , you know , three times a week . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###No , E_S ###you ca n't do that very often . E_S 
8522:11	###So , the thing \[ is , \+ is \] basically that I spend , like , maybe thirty-five , forty dollars every two weeks \[ on , \+ on \] groceries E_S ###and that 's about it . E_S ###But the thing , uh , also is that , you know , like if you want *-1 to go out like if you want *-2 to go to a restaurant or something , then I have *-3 to moderate that because it 's like I ca n't go *-4 eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars , um , you know , three times a week . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###No , E_S ###you ca n't do that very often . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###So , I mean , it 's , N_S ###\[ for , \+ for \] us , you know , it 's like , \[ \[ I , I \+ \] can spend , \+ I can spend \] that money E_S ###but \[ it 's not , \+ it 's not \] what I want *-1 to spend it on *T*-2 , you know . E_S 
8547:10	###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###So , you got *-1 to make , uh , N_S ###so how do you keep track of where you are *T*-1 \[ in , \+ in \] your monthly spending *T*-2 ? E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Well , the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that , um , \[ I ba- , \+ I basically \] know how much I have *T*-1 , right ? E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . 
8602:11	###SpeakerB40 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###And , um , because it 's considered *-1 a luxury in other countries . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###So , you just call him direct E_S ###and then , N_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Right . E_S 
8714:25	###SpeakerA83 . ###Well then , uh , see , uh , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] one of the points which I do n't see *T*-1 , E_S ###like \[ I , \+ I \] do n't give a lot of gifts during Christmas E_S ###and \[ \[ I , \+ you know , I \] do n't wa- , \+ I do n't like \] *-1 to give any at all E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###because the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that , you know , it 's like if I want something \[ I 'll , \+ I 'll \] ask somebody , you know , E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah . E_S 
8726:50	###And I said , I want a backpack . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###You kno- , no , E_S ###I told him \[ yo- , \+ \] if you want *-1 to give me a present for Christmas * give me a backpack . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's something that you can use *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . 
8757:15	###\[ it was , \+ to me it was \] ridiculous , E_S because you know , you have *-2 to , N_S ###once a year you go out E_S ###and you spend all this money on all these people , E_S ###and some you do n't care about *T*-1 , you know , E_S ###it 's like , N_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###That 's true , E_S ###why bother . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###Yeah . E_S 
8875:8	###but then , I get the opportunity *-1 to vacuum , E_S ###so I guess 0 I get some of both . E_S ###What *T*-1 are some of your things 0 you like *-2 to do *T*-3 ? E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Well , when I have time *T*-1 I do like *-2 to sew , E_S ###um , I had been doing a lot of crocheting . E_S ###I make a lot of afghans or used *-1 to make a lot of them . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . 
8914:8	###SpeakerA19 . ###Well , that 's kind of what my wife says *T*-1 . E_S ###She enjoys *-1 doing it during the cold weather because she 's always got something 0 * to cover \[ her , \+ her \] legs and feet with *T*-2 while she is working on it . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###I know 0 it seems like , she , N_S ###I think 0 she made three *ICH*-1 this year one for , uh , my father-in-law and then a couple of brothers and sisters . E_S ###So , those things they take some time 0 * to make *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . 
8916:27	###She enjoys *-1 doing it during the cold weather because she 's always got something 0 * to cover \[ her , \+ her \] legs and feet with *T*-2 while she is working on it . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###I know 0 it seems like , she , N_S ###I think 0 she made three *ICH*-1 this year one for , uh , my father-in-law and then a couple of brothers and sisters . E_S ###So , those things they take some time 0 * to make *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I found one that *T*-1 's real easy , E_S 
8950:24	###I guess 0 that is your standard knitting , is n't it *?* ? E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###Usually single crochet \[ \[ \[ would , \+ is , \] \+ is \] \+ always starts \] it off . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I know , E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###If we have a problem with our connection and get disconnected *-1 some time or other , * do n't worry about it . E_S 
8965:8	###SpeakerA35 . ###Instead of call waiting or call anything else . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###No , E_S ###no . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###SpeakerB38 . ###We ca n't have that down here . E_S ###We get disconnected *-1 all the time . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . 
9003:16	###but * always got *-1 to the keep those planted . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Yeah , E_S ###oh , my husband does n't like them either , E_S ###but I can always give them away . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Well , that 's kind of the way 0 I am *T*-1 , um . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Besides they 're fun 0 * to grow *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . 
9007:11	###but I can always give them away . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Well , that 's kind of the way 0 I am *T*-1 , um . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Besides they 're fun 0 * to grow *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###I planted , uh , zucchini last year . E_S ###Uh , I planted four hills of them . E_S ###I think 0 I had three or four seeds in each one of them , E_S ###and those things just flat took over . E_S 
9024:13	###SpeakerA53 . ###I would think so , um , E_S ###* seems like \[ these all , \+ they all \] went \[ to , \+ uh , to \] leaf , E_S ###and it was n't until late in the summer 0 they started *-1 making fruit *T*-2 . E_S ###So , I do n't know if I , N_S ###Mom would say 0 you planted them in the wrong sign of the moon . You know , E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###but \[ I do n't , \+ I had n't \] looked at a farmers almanac *-1 to find out when a good time for zucchini is *T*-2 . E_S 
9041:39	###SpeakerA59 . ###You think 0 they 're later in the year ? E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Uh . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###About the same time that you plant okra *T*-1 because it 's supposed *-2 to be warm . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Well , that 's true . E_S 
9147:6	###so it 's hard , E_S ###I never did see the full story , E_S ###so I do n't know . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###But they said \[ that , \+ that \] it really caused so much smog *ICH*-2 over , uh , the Grand Canyon in the winter months that they could n't do the , uh , piloting , uh , you know , the helicopter trips and that sort of thing . Which *T*-1 would be horrible , because \[ the , \+ there 's \] nothing , E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . 
9236:8	###SpeakerA57 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Uh , I probably would n't mind if it really came down to it . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Well it 's just the same thing with \[ the car , \+ uh , uh , the gasoline , \] E_S ###now is a wonderful time 0 * to smack a fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline *T*-1 , so that we do n't , uh , run into the kind of problems 0 we recently had *T*-2 E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Oh yes , E_S ###yes , E_S 
9249:11	###and \[ they do n't want , \+ they do n't want \] *-1 to pay for it . E_S ###So instead , we spend billions of dollars *-1 going to war . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Uh , you know , wha- , N_S ###however , it might have had other causes . E_S ###Certainly oil was a big factor . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Oh certainly , E_S 
9407:33	###SpeakerA29 . ###Yeah , E_S ###a little bit . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###You must , well , uh , N_S ###it must be quite a bit hotter down there , is n't it *?* ? E_S 
9438:4	###SpeakerA39 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###I mean , that 's really bad . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , I mean , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] guess 0 I 've been in some places , you know , where the weather was just so mild *T*-1 , you know , places like Monterey , California or , you know , N_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S 
9481:34	###SpeakerA55 . ###No , E_S ###the other topics . E_S ###I got one topic , E_S ###they said * talk about the Middle East situ- , ###well , E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###I guess 0 we 're supposed *-1 to say good-bye or something , and think about what N_S ###my daughter is here *-1 prodding me to say good-bye . E_S ###We messed up the conversation , anyway . E_S 
9490:6	###We messed up the conversation , anyway . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Well I mean I 've had some pretty bad , I guess some pretty controversial topics E_S ###so it 's just like well that was my fault . E_S ###But then the weather 's like , N_S ###man , I mean , it gets pretty mundane , E_S ###I mean you can only talk \[ about , \+ about \] the situation just so long . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I know , E_S 
9512:27	###And I would MUMBLEx it like that , N_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] like the adventure of it .

20259:59	###but I do n't think , uh , 0 anybody is just going *-1 to come in and fix it in a couple of weeks , because they 've been messing it up for many years , now .

20509:10	###SpeakerA99 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###SpeakerA101 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###Just because of exactly what you said *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB104 .

20946:40	###They pick up newspapers , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Oh , do they really . E_S ###Curbside pick up ? E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###I really hope 0 they do that in Louisville . E_S ###It would make it a lot easier on all of us . E_S ###SpeakerB76 .

21310:12	###\[ He gets , \+ um , he 's \] doing amazing things E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###but he 's doing them within the bounds of what a normal person would do *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Right , E_S ###right , E_S ###that 's a good point , E_S ###SpeakerB32 . 
21326:23	###SpeakerA35 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###And , \[ I , \+ I \] like the old \[ ser- , \+ series \] better when , um Dede was in there *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Dede , E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Yeah , E_S

E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
21413:22	###I do n't know , E_S ###but \[ I just , \+ I like \] \[ the , \+ the \] cut and dry * solve the mystery , E_S ###and that 's what *ICH*-2 I always enjoyed *T*-1 about it .

21446:126	###SpeakerB80 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###\[ A , \+ a , \] good example of \[ this , ###and , \+ you know , this \] is probabl- , N_S ###maybe it 's not a good example .

21535:56	###SpeakerB116 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA117 . ###So . I always thought 0 that was kind of weird . E_S ###SpeakerB118 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it *EXP*-1 's funny how \[ \[ we , \+ uh , we , \] \+ we \] romanticize people *T*-2 E_S ###SpeakerA119 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB120 . 
21758:10	###SpeakerA48 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB49 . ###and that was the most boring place on earth . E_S ###SpeakerA50 . ###Oh , now my husband and I , we go different places .

22106:62	###but the crime spreads out into the more affluent divisions through robberies , rape and , uh , car crime .

22366:10	###SpeakerB98 . ###it 's very prevalent , E_S ###a lot of the crime is very prevalent . E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###Yes , E_S ###they 're very bold it seems 0 *T*-1 .

22379:6	###and um , those that *T*-1 are n't , N_S ###there 's Celinas which *T*-1 is about a fifteen minute drive , which *T*-2 is mostly migrant workers , E_S ###and there 's a lot of crime there , um , ###migrant Hispanic farm workers , people that *T*-1 are down and out , E_S ###and uh , they all seem *-1 to congregate in Celinas , not so much here in Monterrey .

22469:6	###SpeakerA19 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###so , \[ it 's , \+ they do \] a lot of shark fishing \[ in that , \+ you know , in the \] gulf E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Right .

23724:9	###and I 'll cook it . E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB29 . ###You know , like you have *-1 to prepare the fire , and then put the sausages on , E_S ###and then , you know , you put all these different meats which *T*-1 take different times .

24133:17	###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Um , something \[ that \+ ###\[ I , \+ I \] think that I 've noticed that \] N_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] have a friend , E_S ###I think 0 if you 're going into like , uh , law or medicine , a very particular , very specific field , \[ even , \+ even \] engineering , \[ you can get , \+ you can meet \] a lot of the requirements at a public , um , institution .

E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Well , what about random testing , though . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . 
24539:55	###say if you change jobs you would n't have *-1 to do it if you 'd just been tested *-2 at your other work place . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Well , what about random testing , though . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Do you feel like that 's an \[ in- , \+ invasion \] of certain people 's rights if not everyone is tested *-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh , not if it 's done *-1 fairly . E_S ###And that 's probably my question is , \[ how , \+ how \] do you know 0 it 's done *-1 fairly *T*-2 . E_S 
24549:18	###SpeakerA17 . ###I do n't know that you do . E_S ###If it 's random , then it 's random E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###and that 's not necessarily fair . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Well , they might tell you 0 it 's random . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . 
24563:38	###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###SpeakerA25 . ###Well , \[ I ha- , \+ I know \] that , for instance , in the N C double A , they drug test E_S ###and it 's not random .

24588:29	###SpeakerA33 . ###Well , *-1 not being a drug user I do n't have a problem with that personally E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###SpeakerA35 . ###SpeakerB36 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###but I think 0 that might be a violation of someone 's rights .

24601:8	###SpeakerB40 . ###SpeakerA41 . ###I mean if someone assumed that of me , I would be upset . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ it , \+ it \] would almost be like \[ a , \+ a , \] uh ... N_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###It 's an accusation , E_S 
24612:83	###SpeakerB44 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Right , E_S ###exactly . E_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ I \] do n't , E_S ###\+ \[ the , \+ \] I think \] 0 almost the only way that drug testing can be done *-1 fairly *T*-2 is if it 's across the board \[ from , \+ from \] the janitors to the executive management . E_S 
24665:106	###SpeakerB64 . ###Right . E_S ###Well , \[ does \[ your , \+ \] the company say , \+ for instance , does the company \] 0 you worked for *T*-1 \[ bef- , \+ before \] have the right *RNR*-2 or do they have the ability *RNR*-2 * to say , hey , we 've already drug tested her E_S ###and she came up negative . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Well , no , E_S ###I do n't think 0 \[ they can , \+ they can \] force another company to not drug test me just by *-1 saying that \[ I , \+ I \] did n't , I mean , N_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . 
24723:85	###SpeakerB88 . ###Oh , I see . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###They say \[ we , \+ we 're \] testing you tomorrow E_S ###and we 'll test you every three months thereafter while you work here . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Okay , E_S ###so they know that . E_S ###And that 's ... N_S 
24789:10	###I would n't let them go to a public school system there . E_S ###But , of course , people are trapped *-1 economically E_S ###and they ca n't do that . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I know 0 down here the schools are , you know , N_S ###I do n't know , E_S ###they rate , N_S ###I moved to Arkansas and Texas after *-1 living in Ohio E_S ###and the schools down here rate , you know , *-1 bottom ten percent across the country E_S 
24834:36	###SpeakerB22 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###SpeakerB24 . ###Or if you 're going *-1 to go the science route you can go to a target school that *T*-2 specializes in science or art .

24882:46	###\[ and , \+ or \] maybe they 're unemployed E_S ###and they 're mad at the world , E_S ###I can see where that would n't be very good for \[ a , \+ a \] kid *T*-1 , you know , E_S ###he 's coming up , will you help me with my homework E_S ###and they 're , no , * get away from me , E_S ###I 've had a terrible day .

24920:10	###SpeakerB48 . ###Yeah .

25063:161	###SpeakerA7 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###and \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] not in our national consciousness * to do it .

E_S ###I had six years of college E_S ###and I do n't know the metric system 
25130:6	###but , I mean , a lot of people are flat not educated E_S ###and if I have a hard time , you know *-1 putting that into my life , can we put that off on the other eighty percent of the population that *T*-2 does n't have any college E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Really .

25195:8	###* Just leave them *-1 alone , E_S ###* let them measure their drinking water in cups E_S ###and * leave them *-1 alone . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Yeah .

25300:8	###SpeakerB8 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well , um , oh , I guess 0 another thing 0 I 've noticed *T*-1 , too , here lately is that even though we 've had some pretty warm days , it 's been awfully gray , you know , just , N_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Yeah , E_S ###now , the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Yeah . E_S ###But it seems like every time 0 at work I look out my window *T*-1 it 's gray . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . 
25357:38	###SpeakerB26 . ###Yeah . E_S ###You 're probably right . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###I mean , any other time of year , that 's not the case , because it could be very warm or very cold .

26053:7	###SpeakerA71 . ###Yeah , E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###You know . Especially if you \[ get , \+ forget \] *-1 to record those little suckers . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Yeah , E_S ###exactly . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###SpeakerA75 . ###Plastic is just too easy , E_S

26082:11	###but \[ I , \+ I \] do n't really usually consider that an option .

E_S ###Well , I 'm sorry *-1 to hear 0 your color did n't come out so good over the weekend . E_S 
27758:12	###It kind of reminds me of my roots of * growing up E_S ###and \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] become I guess 0 *T*-1 more of a country fan over the years . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###When you say that you grew up , uh , in the sixties *T*-1 I take it 0 that was the , uh , teenage type years E_S ###or , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that was my teenage years .

27826:11	###for some reason \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] not a whole lot of his stuff that I 'm real crazy about *T*-5 , E_S ###but he does have some things .

28013:34	###SpeakerA20 . ###and we 'll see how the generations go *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###SpeakerA22 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I , N_S ###at least for a lot of women depending \[ on , \+ on \] what she did *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB23 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA24 . 
28044:10	###SpeakerA32 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB33 . ###Well that 's the thing , see , you know , E_S ###maybe if you get along E_S ###for example if you 'd been a technician instead of an engineer . E_S ###You know , the technicians work the eight to five job and know when they 're going *-1 to be there *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA34 . ###Yeah , E_S ###* might have been better . E_S 
28177:133	###SpeakerA84 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB85 . ###Well , \[ it , \+ it 's \] his job too . E_S ###And I , N_S ###to me the only important issue is the children , E_S ###because as far as housework goes , you know , men can do housework just as easily as women , E_S ###and thanks to a lot of new inventions , housework does n't take as much time as it used *-1 to *?* .

28339:12	###SpeakerB155 . ###Yes . E_S ###I 'm saying this as I 'm trying *-1 to keep my nine month old from *-2 trashing something .

28605:6	###it 's actually a dot matrix printer E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###Huh-uh . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###but the quality is almost laser quality . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###Oh , huh-uh .

28755:22	###so I had *-1 to kind of change my life-style a little bit . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Well , * let me ask a personal question , E_S ###how old are you *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Thirty-eight . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Oh , well then you should E_S ###see over thirty-five everything goes downhill flop . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . 
28764:13	###SpeakerA9 . ###Well , the rest of me is in pretty good shape E_S ###it 's just that left knee that *T*-1 just does n't want *-2 to do everything 0 it used *-4 to *?* *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Oh , you 're lucky then E_S ###because I 've battled arthritis all my life , E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Really ? E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###I mean even since I was like about two or three . E_S 
28816:51	###and you probably do . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah , E_S ###but you have *-1 to have an indoor pool . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###This is true . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###So , * to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without , you know , * drawing a lot of looks *T*-2 , means 0 you 're really going *-1 to do a strenuous workout activity MUMBLEx E_S ###you look very odd in the water , E_S ###SpeakerA33 . 
28842:25	###SpeakerA39 . ###It is *?* . E_S ###They keep it at eighty-one degrees year-round . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Huh . E_S ###He- , N_S ###do you use that facility a lot ? E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Um , \[ a fairly , \+ a fairly \] good amount , uh , ###more on the weekends , E_S 
28984:68	###and he 's got a good salary E_S ###we did n't think that you 'd be coming back anyway , E_S ###and , uh , you know , we 've got people *ICH*-1 here that *T*-2 really , you know , need *-3 to be working E_S ###and so that we had just , N_S you know , ###it was , this way we did n't have *-1 to layoff an active person E_S ###and we 'd just let you go . E_S ###And it took me about a year of * arguing , E_S ###I said , you know , I 've got *-1 to put this in writing to me , \[ and \+ \] because until they put it in writing , I could n't get my insurance benefits E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###Yeah . E_S 
29008:6	###SpeakerB96 . ###I still do n't think that , \[ they \+ \] after my experiences that they could , you know , get me to go back , ever again . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] can understand . E_S ###I can understand . E_S ###Well , it *EXP*-1 's been good * talking with you . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###But * let me ask you this , since you use Texans , E_S ###how much *ICH*-1 is it a month ? E_S ###SpeakerA99 . 
29086:10	###and you 'd probably like the pool there . E_S ###SpeakerB126 . ###Oh , God it sounds like I would *?* . E_S ###I might do that then . E_S ###Okay , E_S ###I learned something here . E_S ###SpeakerA127 . ###Well , good . E_S ###I 'm glad . E_S ###SpeakerB128 . 
29121:99	###SpeakerA4 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###SpeakerA6 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###So , uh , I mean , \[ when you , \+ when you \] take , uh , uh , professionals and put them in situations , 0 they have *-1 to make decisions based * on money 0 * to fund public education *T*-3 *T*-2 *T*-4 , E_S ###and they ca n't get their finger out of their ear long enough * \[ to , \+ to \] get that major subject in line , E_S ###something 's wrong . E_S ###So , I think here in Texas mainly that \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ they 're \] not serious , E_S 
29168:135	###SpeakerA20 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###they do n't have *-1 to do sit-ups and push-ups and all that crap 0 we had *-3 to do *T*-2 when we were going to school *T*-4 . E_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###I remember . E_S ###SpeakerB23 . ###And , yeah , E_S ###and , uh , I talked to a thirteen year old *ICH*-2 last night who *T*-1 \[ 's , \+ uh , goes \] to , uh , one of the Plano high schools or junior highs , I guess , E_S ###and she said that she had a choice , E_S 
29309:17	###SpeakerA23 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###and I enjoy that quite a bit . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Um , one of the women that I work with *T*-1 , her husband is Iranian . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . 
29316:42	###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###So here lately with all the Middle Eastern news we 've had some very interesting conversations over lunch . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###I will admit 0 I work with , uh , someone who *T*-1 's Iranian , E_S ###and he definitely has a very different slant on the news . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . 
29335:77	###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###SpeakerB34 . ###True , um , E_S ###the , N_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###I understand that the MacNeil Lehrer probably does n't . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###They , um , tend *-1 to spend quite a bit of time on one story . E_S 
29401:67	###but these guys had \[ a , \+ a , \] uh , national soap box 0 * to stand on *T*-1 \[ and , \+ and \] express this view . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###You know , one of the best television news shows that I saw *T*-1 during the war was a show on a Saturday morning on A B C , E_S ###and it was for children E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###and it was hosted *-1 by Peter Jennings , E_S ###and it was so interesting because they were relating the war to these children in their studio , E_S ###and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions . E_S 
29554:6	###and the other one has some weird ones that I 've never heard of *T*-1 . E_S ###So , N_S ###SpeakerB114 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] actually take both newspapers on the weekends . E_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###Do you ? E_S ###SpeakerB116 . ###I figure 0 I 'm only taking on the weekend , E_S ###and I can afford that . E_S ###SpeakerA117 . 
29571:24	###SpeakerB120 . ###I get the TIMES HERALD just *-1 to balance that out a little bit . E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###He takes both San Antonio papers , an Austin paper , both Houston papers , E_S ###I guess 0 he takes seven , ###the San Marcos paper and the New Braunsfel paper , E_S ###but he 's a football coach at Southwest Texas State University , E_S ###so he 's getting all the sports sections . E_S ###SpeakerB122 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
29781:19	###How will I dust this thing *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###You 're right . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###That 's terrible . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###No E_S ###that 's true . E_S ###That 's funny . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . 
29879:27	###It sounds like you 'd have lots of shading on that particular piece . E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###SpeakerA101 . ###Yep . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###It \[ is not , \+ does not \] sound like an easy one 0 * to finish *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###No , E_S 
30053:104	###I 'd sent them , you know , several hundred dollars , or whatever I felt 0 I would spend *T*-6 . And then use it then . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###SpeakerA35 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###SpeakerA37 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . 
30214:21	###SpeakerB108 . ###Oh . * Thank you very much . E_S ###But , as Jack said , I 'm one of \[ the , \+ the \] old hands in the speech business . E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###Oh really . E_S ###SpeakerB110 . ###Yeah , E_S ###uh . Yes , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I 've \] been doing it for twenty some odd years . E_S ###SpeakerA111 . 
30391:69	###SpeakerA49 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###and he goes in \[ and prin- , \+ and types \] his checks on the screen and then hits print , E_S ###and they print out on the checks , E_S ###and he 's ordered envelopes with the windows in the right places you know , E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Oh my gosh . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###and he just whips , out , you know , N_S 
30476:4	###I mean , they require it . E_S ###You have *-1 to type it you know , E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###\[ and , \+ and so \] I 'm up here , you know , nights and weekends you know , *-1 working \[ on the little p- , \+ on the P C \] up here , you know , typing stuff . E_S ###So I can see where it would be a great advantage * to have one at home , you know , if you were going to school *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Yeah , E_S ###any more I do n't even know \[ if they have , \+ if a college kid would have \] a typewriter . E_S 
30880:21	###instead of * having X now , they have what , N C seventeen ? E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###They just changed it because X had a connotation with it , you know , E_S ###so , N_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###And even on those type they do n't show what you expect *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Right . E_S 
30997:42	###I do n't know if they have the , uh , original actors on that first one to that one . E_S ###SpeakerB108 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###They 're supposed *-1 to be coming out with all these Desert Storm movies , this summer , too . E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB110 . ###SpeakerA111 . ###I expected those . E_S ###SpeakerB112 . 
31149:49	###SpeakerA32 . ###SpeakerB33 . ###SpeakerA34 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB35 . ###SpeakerA36 . ###Right . E_S ###And even if I knew how * to teach the subject matter *T*-1 , I do n't know if I 'd know how * to handle that kind of \[ a , \+ a \] group of kids *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S 
31160:62	###SpeakerA38 . ###I tell you what I 'm finding *T*-1 frightening E_S ###and this comes from , you know , \[ the , \+ the \] aging hippie near forty mother . E_S ###So I went through this period of supposedly , you know , cosmic social enlightenment . E_S ###SpeakerB39 . ###SpeakerA40 . ###\[ I 'm on , \+ I 'm in \] the Plano school system and living in Richardson , E_S ###and there is a real dichotomy in terms of educational and economic background of the kids that *T*-1 are going *-2 to be attending this school . E_S ###SpeakerB41 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
31184:33	###I thought , well , \[ how do you , \+ how do you \] weed those out *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB47 . ###Yes . E_S ###Some of those certainly have a lot of \[ dis- , \+ difficulties , \] you know , with , uh , all sorts of things , E_S ###SpeakerA48 . ###SpeakerB49 . ###and I would imagine 0 their learning disabilities are quite large in some cases . E_S ###SpeakerA50 . ###When I was listening to N P R , the National Public Radio *T*-1 , N_S ###and they 've quoted statistics that \[ I just about , \+ \] my throat just about fell into my toes *T*-1 . E_S 
31227:9	###SpeakerB63 . ###SpeakerA64 . ###And I keep *-1 thinking , you know , 0 gifted \[ is , \+ is \] Einstein or , you know , uh , musical prodigies .

E_S ###SpeakerB67 . ###Huh . E_S 
31277:68	###I would really think that they should be stressing more can the kid write a thought and at an early age .

E_S ###SpeakerB77 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerA78 . ###Well , my stepson , you know , \[ I , \+ \] he went into the Navy or Air Force . E_S ###I just really get my military , N_S ###I married into a military family , E_S 
31337:40	###I do n't need *-1 to work . E_S ###Maybe I should volunteer *-1 to , you know , teach what I know *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB99 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA100 . ###Maybe adult literacy .

E_S ###Do I reall- , . N_S ###SpeakerB101 . ###SpeakerA1 . 
31437:46	###SpeakerA41 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###But , um , and eventually that 's going *-1 to show up anyway in the way 0 he works , and so on *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###Well , \[ \[ there 's , \+ yeah , there , \] \+ there 's \] going *-1 to be some measure of incentive , uh , reward or whatever , E_S ###but the reward ultimately comes down to what you want *T*-1 .

E_S ###They landscape their whole house with flower gardens . E_S ###SpeakerB146 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA147 . 
32066:4	###and then \[ the re- , \+ the heat \] sets in .

32789:15	###SpeakerB288 . ###I see . E_S ###SpeakerA289 . ###They 're up and doing fine . E_S ###SpeakerB290 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I , uh , N_S ###those onions , I think , \[ we , \+ we \] planted like twice as much this year because , you know , we got , \[ on- , \+ onions \] E_S ###and they lasted from , you know , \[ about \+ when you harvest them *T*-1 about \] a month from now or so , or six weeks , from now , \[ until , \+ until \] like October , E_S ###SpeakerA291 .

E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###and it 's usually well liked *-1 by people , I guess 0 *T*-2 , E_S ###I 'm just a seafood fan E_S ###so , I think on the lines of , N_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Well , \[ how do , make , \+ how do \[ you , \+ you \] cook \] crawfish *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###SpeakerB22 . 
33061:68	###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###And you 're not supposed *-1 to eat those because they 're bad for you . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Okay . E_S ###Well , I 'll remember that . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah , E_S ###so if you ever go in a restaurant , * order crawfish , E_S 
33074:12	###SpeakerB34 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###But , um , you just put some Cajun , well , lots of pepper E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Uh-huh .

33103:57	###SpeakerB44 . ###* Still have see that . ###Ooh . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###So , um \[ it , \+ it \] would just depend . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###SpeakerA47 . ###SpeakerB48 . ###SpeakerA49 . ###That 's the best part of the crawfish . E_S 
33148:42	###SpeakerA63 . ###SpeakerB64 . ###And N_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###That 's what I need *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Yeah E_S ###that 's what I wish 0 I had *T*-1 E_S ###but in our family I am the one who who *T*-1 cooks E_S ###And \[ I \+ I \] really enjoy it E_S 
33332:11	###SpeakerA163 . ###Um-hum E_S ###SpeakerB164 . ###SpeakerA165 . ###Oh E_S ###SpeakerB166 . ###So \[ it 's not a \+ it 's not a \] thick rich type of a sauce E_S ###it 's more of a N_S ###when you use corn starch \[ in \+ in \] gravy *T*-1 like you know when you have um Chinese food *T*-2 That kind of a gravy or a sauce that *T*-3 comes with a lot of that ###They use corn starch instead of flour in all of their sauces and gravies E_S 
33467:4	###SpeakerA7 . ###That 's what the nurses kept *-2 saying *T*-1 as they laughed all the way , you know , down the hallway . E_S ###Do you do anything on a regular basis ? E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Well , off and on , E_S ###off and on . E_S ###Right now I 've been off E_S ###but , I 've been going over to the fitness center . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Yeah , E_S 
33512:12	###SpeakerB18 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's true . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Or is that what you 're into *T*-1 E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###No , E_S ###No , E_S ###well , I 've used the Nautilus equipment . And the bikes , and stair climbers , and stuff like that mostly . E_S 
33833:8	###SpeakerA131 . ###\[ I do n't think 0 I 've ever , \+ I think 0 I 've , \] N_S ###there was some girl there . E_S ###I 've been there like , maybe a dozen times .

E_S 
33962:11	###But , uh , I bought it for target practicing \[ and , \+ uh , and \] also because I wanted a weapon . E_S ###Uh , how do you feel about it *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Well , I think , uh , 0 down here in Texas they do n't have a waiting period on handguns . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###And , I think 0 they need that . E_S ###Uh , and \[ I do have a , \+ I have a \] pistol . E_S ###It 's a little twenty-two E_S 
33982:11	###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###But , uh , I like *-1 to have them \[ where \+ \] handy . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Well , \[ up , \+ uh , up \] in New England where I 'm from *T*-1 , uh , you had *-2 to get a permit before you could buy any \[ \[ amu- , \+ am- , \] \+ ammunition . \] E_S ###And I thought 0 that was really good .

34042:5	###\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ at times I \] think 0 they ought *-1 to have a waiting period on all firearms . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I do too .

E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###A shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh , yeah . E_S ###I suppose . E_S 
34049:6	###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh , yeah . E_S ###I suppose . E_S ###I never got shot *-1 with either one . E_S ###But I do n't know , uh , E_S ###I think 0 you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###No , E_S ###a shotgun 's got too much of a spread . E_S ###Or at least ours does . E_S 
34049:22	###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh , yeah . E_S ###I suppose . E_S ###I never got shot *-1 with either one .

34072:8	###SpeakerB48 . ###Uh , I 've got a manual single shot E_S ###and I guess 0 it does n't have \[ any , \+ any \] automatic features to it . E_S ###The further away 0 I get *T*-1 , \[ the , \+ the , \] uh , wider the shot gets *T*-2 from the target . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###And the closer that I get *T*-1 , the tighter that it gets *T*-2 . E_S ###It 's got a hell of a kick to it . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . 
34076:57	###SpeakerA49 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###And the closer that I get *T*-1 , the tighter that it gets *T*-2 . E_S ###It 's got a hell of a kick to it . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Yeah . E_S ###My husband had \[ a , \+ uh , a \] police gun at one time . E_S ###And I shot that thing one time . E_S ###* Almost knocked me down . E_S 
34220:21	###If they go to , uh , *-1 \[ regulating , \+ uh , all right , uh , banning \] guns . \[ \[ \[ Pri- , \+ pri- , \] \+ pri- , \] \+ private \] \[ cit- , \+ citizens \] N_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###SpeakerA105 . ###My husband feels that they 'll come and collect everybody 's guns . E_S 
34230:6	###SpeakerB106 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I guess 0 that could happen . E_S ###It 's just like \[ the , \+ uh , the \] social security system . E_S ###Once \[ they , \+ uh , they \] gave everybody a number E_S ###and now they 're making you , uh , uh , get one \[ at , \+ at \] birth . E_S ###SpeakerA107 . ###SpeakerB108 . ###And once they have your number , they have your identification . E_S ###SpeakerA109 . 
34258:71	###SpeakerA115 . ###Oh , the Soc- , N_S ###SpeakerB116 . ###SpeakerA117 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ They , \+ they \] probably know everything from *ICH*-2 , half the time \[ \[ wh- , \+ ho- , \] \+ what \] time you go to the bathroom *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB118 . ###They probably do .

34333:4	###Uh , but I would like *-1 to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who *T*-2 has what weapons . E_S ###SpeakerA143 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well , I agree with you there . E_S ###They do have too much control over us already . E_S ###SpeakerB144 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA145 . ###Uh , we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB146 . 
34362:9	###SpeakerA5 . ###I have n't seen that one yet . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###That 's an excellent movie . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Um , the last movie 0 I saw *T*-1 was , uh , * SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Oh , was that good . E_S ###I heard , N_S ###SpeakerA9 . 
34437:79	###and she 's got two boys that I took *T*-1 *-2 to see the first one . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###So I 'm sure 0 I 'm going *-1 to see the next one here real soon . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Amarillo . E_S ###I did n't see the first one . E_S ###My husband said 0 it was , um , about the same lines . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . 
34551:19	###SpeakerB76 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###And , uh , I thought 0 he did such an excellent job of * not going that far . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Yeah , E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Now , by the end he was looking more like a cop . ###But at the beginning of the movie and all through the middle part , you know , he was \[ trying * to , \+ trying *-1 to \] get it , E_S ###SpeakerB80 . 
34706:12	###SpeakerA143 . ###No , E_S ###nowhere near that expensive . E_S ###SpeakerB144 . ###So they get you at the ticket booth and then try and get you at the popcorn and coke . E_S ###SpeakerA145 . ###And , \[ it , \+ it 's \] just the idea that \[ these , \+ uh , these \] actors , you know , live in such lavish style . E_S ###I mean , it 's as simple as that . E_S ###SpeakerB146 . ###Yeah . E_S 
34850:6	###SpeakerA197 . ###\[ \[ It 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ it 's \] a long movie . E_S ###SpeakerB198 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and I heard 0 the video 's even going *-1 to be longer . E_S ###SpeakerA199 . ###Oh yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB200 . ###They did a lot of stuff that they cut *T*-1 out . E_S ###SpeakerA201 . 
35081:37	###SpeakerA68 . ###Well , that 's true . E_S ###SpeakerB69 . ###It *EXP*-1 's hard * to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that . E_S ###That ca n't be the problem . E_S ###SpeakerA70 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB71 . ###It must be the marketing pressures , E_S ###and , you know , their demographic studies that they do *T*-2 that *T*-1 show , you know , that everybody 's I Q has dropped dramatically or something . E_S 
35194:63	###SpeakerA110 . ###SpeakerB111 . ###You know what I did *T*-1 . E_S ###There was a time there where I could tape things *T*-1 E_S ###and then I 'd fast forward through the commercials .

35345:8	###SpeakerA7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###so we need a car that *T*-1 's big enough for six . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###And so \[ we went , \+ I guess 0 it was *ICH*-1 two weekends ago , we went , \] uh , *-2 car shopping and looked around . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Uh-huh . E_S

E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###But \[ I just , \+ I \] kind of worry about *-2 getting a car that *T*-1 's that new with low mileage on it because you wonder why did the person that *T*-3 owned it want *-4 to get rid *-5 of it *T*-6 .

35625:13	###SpeakerB128 . ###It 's \[ a , \+ a \] Buick Century . E_S ###SpeakerA129 . ###Uh-huh .

35836:14	###SpeakerB14 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###I do n't think 0 it 's a bad idea , E_S ###* \[ teaches , \+ teaches \] a lot .

36211:20	###SpeakerB158 . ###Yeah , E_S ###oh yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA159 . ###You know , \[ \[ it 's just , \+ it 's , \] \+ it 's \] ridiculous the way 0 unions have gone *T*-1 .

36343:21	###It 's something 0 I can do *T*-1 with her , plus , um , does n't tax me too physically . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###I have enjoyed aerobics in the past , E_S ###and I enjoy that because I like the group association , you know , like *-1 exercising with other people .

36465:14	###SpeakerA57 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###And I was going *-1 to wait until , um , about my sixth month and then start that . E_S ###I did that with the second baby , E_S ###and , um , I went to my exercise class one day , E_S ###and then she was delivered *-1 the next day . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Gosh . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . 
36631:57	###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Well , it 's not that bad E_S ###but it 's still pretty chilly . E_S ###Um , I do n't know , E_S ###\[ I was , \+ I have \] a tent E_S ###and I fluff out in it , in the backyard and stuff , E_S ###but this thing about camping that *T*-1 bothers me is 0 you 've got *-2 to pack everything E_S ###and another thing is 0 the thing seems *-1 to get , N_S 
36641:8	###it 's dirty you know , E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###so , you ca n't keep the dirt out of the tent . E_S ###I do n't know E_S ###we have a seven year old , E_S ###it 's pretty funny , E_S ###like * stay out . E_S ###SpeakerB24 .

36712:6	###there 's no bugs . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Huh .

E_S 
36733:82	###SpeakerB42 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###I mean , just the very second , E_S ###it 's really strange . E_S ###\[ They , \+ uh , they \] must , uh , work on that , you know , E_S ###\[ \[ the , \+ i- , \] \+ it \] gets cooler when the sun sets *T*-1 E_S ###and then they all come out .

36812:6	###SpeakerA61 . ###Yep . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###And \[ he just , \+ he just \] tows it behind his truck .

E_S ###Um , and they sleep in the pop-up . E_S 
36911:71	###and the one time that we went , we got one *T*-1 , E_S it was overlooking the water E_S ###but it was a big embankment , E_S ###I wanted *-1 to get one right on the water .

36922:6	###I think 0 they are more of a threat to their own people at this day and time . E_S ###how do you feel *T*-1 about it ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , they do have , uh , a major internal problem . E_S ###Everybody wants *-1 to defect , E_S ###and I can understand why . E_S ###Um , I think 0 their biggest problem is just , you know , * obtaining food 0 * to live *T*-1 , E_S ###so when you have the basic needs , uh , being unmet * *T*-1 , I do n't think 0 you think globally as far as , you know , * being a threat to other people in the world .

36954:57	###I think 0 it 's been \[ a good , \+ a good \] positive direction for uh , the Soviets as far as Yeltsin is concerned *-1 .

36981:6	###SpeakerB24 . ###SpeakerA25 . ###and I guess 0 that 's where Yeltsin steps in *T*-1 , so far as his politics of government goes , uh , E_S ###but I do n't know how convinced *ICH*-1 the people are *T*-2 of him yet , myself . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Well , that 's all 0 they got *T*-1 right now . E_S ###That 's their ray of hope . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB28 .

37026:25	###SpeakerB42 . ###\[ I think 0 it 's , \+ I think 0 it 's \] a lot of , uh , oh , how do you put it *T*-1 ? , bureaucracy \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , one thing , and then all the corruption .

37196:19	###SpeakerB32 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###SpeakerB34 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###I have little children , four and one , E_S ###and I decided that it *EXP*-1 was very important to me * to stay home . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Uh-huh . E_S

37466:44	###but it seems that , you know , they can sign him tomorrow , E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh-huh .

38823:17	###I would love *-2 to do crafts and stuff if I just had the time 0 * to do it *T*-3 or if I had the space . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###I 've got a few plants here , E_S ###but I 'm not really knowledgeable . E_S 
39127:92	###So I thought , this 'll \[ help , \+ you know , help \] them shed , E_S ###SpeakerB108 . ###SpeakerA109 . ###and sure enough , boy the fur just came off like crazy once I got them in the tub .

44365:8	###I mean , you can say that about Africa too .

44397:74	###SpeakerA121 . ###SpeakerB122 . ###you know , I think 0 communication does have a lot 0 *T*-1 to do with it , you know , in education , maybe . E_S ###SpeakerA123 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB124 . ###I do n't know about education E_S ###because the black community is still not very educated down there . E_S ###So , I think 0 it is communication , E_S ###it 's just oopsy .

44405:11	###So , I think 0 it is communication , E_S ###it 's just oopsy .

47074:48	###SpeakerB164 . ###Yeah .

47118:33	###SpeakerA3 . ###Well , \[ there , \+ there \] are quite a few , um , \[ parks , \+ I guess , state parks , \] E_S ###and there 's a couple of national parks , I guess 0 *T*-2 , that you can camp at *T*-1 .

47239:16	###you know , they hear desert E_S ###and they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and * being real dry , and lack of water , E_S ###course it , it has all of those qualities E_S ###but it also has a certain quality of beauty that you just do n't find *T*-1 anyway else except in a desert . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###So , it 's pretty nice . E_S ###\[ The , \+ uh , the \] movie , THE DOORS , has \[ so- , \+ some \] nice desert scenes , E_S ###those guys all go *-1 camping out in the desert . E_S 
47272:4	###SpeakerA53 . ###Yeah , E_S ###true . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###But it 's beautiful in February . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###I mean , it 's just beautiful . E_S ###The days , get up into the high eighties , uh , maybe the nineties E_S 
47539:6	###SpeakerB64 . ###Because they 're fancy seats and stuff . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###yeah , E_S ###and you just sit down E_S ###and all the girls were all dressed up MUMBLEx you know , E_S ###I just was there , you know , E_S ###like I 'm loaded , E_S ###I 'm here , you know , E_S ###and , uh , it was just kind of funny E_S \[ because , \+ 
47584:101	###SpeakerA77 . ###Uh-huh .

47600:21	###but you happen *-1 to look the other way during the time , E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###You miss the whole thing .

E_S ###SpeakerB84 . 
47641:6	###SpeakerB98 . ###Yeah , E_S ###Saint Claude , E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###yeah , E_S ###we used *-1 to , N_S ###that 's one of the , um , entrances to the periphery 0 * to get in and out of the city *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . 
47752:36	###SpeakerB128 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA129 . ###and he 's , you know , N_S ###a lot of wisdom in it . E_S ###And the kids at BIBLE talk about anything E_S \[ but training , \+ ###and training \] is different than anything else E_S ###\[ in , \+ in \] psychology does n't address it .

47948:36	###and the children either stay at home and get into trouble E_S ###or they 're stuck in a day care .

48156:15	###Uh , we were fortunate in view of the fact that my son did play football E_S ###and I did keep statistics for his team , E_S ###and , his Dad did take movies of the football team and movies of the basketball team , E_S ###SpeakerA123 . ###Oh , great .

48241:21	###I mean it 's , N_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] should n't say 0 I do n't know if it was any worse , E_S ###but it certainly did n't get any better . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###I usually just , N_S ###I 'm trying *-1 to think of , N_S 
48277:40	###only the guns were in the hands of the criminals , E_S ###but how many times , N_S ###I guess 0 I have never heard of \[ a , \+ a \] robbery being foiled *-1 or spoiled *-1 because the person who *T*-2 's being robbed *-3 had a gun .

48416:31	###but , uh , it has been , uh , used *-1 tremendously , mostly by my children for , uh , * playing games . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Oh .

48605:8	###SpeakerB74 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###So it was really neat . E_S ###I wanted *-1 to go to that course , E_S ###but my boss would n't pay for it , E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###Oh , well . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###I 'm like , I 'll get a job some day

49121:11	###The economy itself around here is not too terribly bad , E_S ###but housing is still real bad . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Well , Pensacola has N_S ###it 's really is a buyer 's market there now . E_S ###SpeakerA49 .

49143:11	###SpeakerA53 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###And home porting was a possibility a few years ago . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Oh .

E_S ###And I mean good , I would , N_S ###* let 's say typical , say three bedroom , uh , two and a half baths , on a half acre or so of land , 
49223:8	###SpeakerB86 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###but otherwise the layout is pretty much the same .

57125:17	###Uh , but mostly what I wear *T*-1 are skirts and blouses or , you know , skirts and , uh , pullover sweaters or , uh , you know , little two piece dress \[ suit , \+ suits \] like , E_S ###but .

57151:4	###you really do n't want *-1 to dress up unless \[ you , \+ you , \] uh , have a job E_S and you have *-1 to be there right after school or something like that , E_S ###so .

E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . 
57222:11	###SpeakerB42 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###he was so excited about *-1 going . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###But , uh , he did n't carry any ties or anything because \[ he , \+ he \] just went over there with \[ the \+ that \] attitude , well if I do n't take it then they wo n't make me wear it . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###That 's true , E_S ###that 's a good idea . E_S 
57386:91	###SpeakerB100 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ it , \+ it \] depends on , um , N_S ###yeah , E_S ###\[ there 's , \+ there 's \] always a reason why they 're on sale *T*-1 .

57454:8	###SpeakerA125 . ###Uh-huh .

57484:16	###SpeakerA7 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###SpeakerA9 . ###No E_S ###there 's no way . E_S ###Somebody once said , uh , ###I had a car that *T*-1 said fuel injection on the side of it E_S ###and a woman asked me what that meant *T*-1 E_S ###and I said 0 that means that I ca n't work on it . E_S 
57580:73	###and , uh , we used *-1 to overhaul farm tractors basically , E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###and they were nearly \[ all , \+ all \] diesel , E_S ###but as far as cars I 've never , never been involved with them . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Well the injector nozzle and stuff in , you know , the big diesel farm tractors , you know , what *T*-1 are about the size of your thumb , E_S and the- , N_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Well , \[ ye- , \+ yeah , \] E_S 
57609:21	###I do n't know exactly why . E_S ###One of the reasons is N_S ###\[ I , \+ I 'm \] beginning *-1 to wonder \[ is , \+ \] where do you get gas at *T*-2 . E_S ###I su- , N_S ###I do n't know if it 's still , uh , limited like it was *?* , E_S ###I do n't notice it , probably because I don- , N_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###What , E_S ###the availability ? E_S ###SpeakerA49 . 
57714:47	###SpeakerB84 . ###The friend of ours over here , he 's got , uh , sixty-five , or sixty-six Mustang the six cylinder . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###And , uh , I was look under the hood of that the other day E_S ###and like you say , you can see the road . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . 
57775:10	###SpeakerB108 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###So it 's trying *-1 to push the weight plus have all this drain on it from all sorts of belts and things . E_S ###But that 's one good thing E_S ###I 've got a , uh , eight ninety , uh , Chevy Blazer now E_S ###and it 's got one , uh , belt on it a serpentine belt . E_S ###SpeakerB110 . ###Oh , it 's that one that *T*-1 's about , uh , what an inch and a half wide . E_S 
57886:15	###and \[ \[ i- , \+ you know , he \] \+ in * looking at the Persian Gulf war that *T*-1 just went on , he , \] N_S ###\[ i- , \+ it \] frustrates him because of the support that they have *T*-1 and the support that the Vietnam vets did not have *T*-2 , from the people or the administration , either one . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Do n't you think that maybe that 's why we had it this time *T*-1 ? E_S ###I mean I do think that , \[ \[ i- , \+ i- , \] \+ it 's \] been too long in * coming E_S ###but I feel like maybe the American people \[ and , \+ and \] the government are aware of the things that we did *T*-1 wrong that we did n't support \[ \[ that , \+ that \] \+ those , \] E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###so many people were opposed to the war , E_S 
57934:16	###He went over there *-1 to get them out of Kuwait , which he did *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###And then he has backed out , E_S ###he has pulled out . E_S ###And I realize 0 they 're still saying , well here you 're encouraging us to get rid *-1 of Saddam Hussein , E_S ###so why are n't you helping us *T*-1 ? E_S ###And you see , I think 0 him going in and doing that would be putting us in another Vietnam situation . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . 
58240:6	###SpeakerB18 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###how on earth am I every going *-1 to do the math *T*-2 ? E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###And the problem is that we tried *-1 to convert everything from inches to centimeters * preserving basically the inches but expressing them as centimeters rather than * saying no , a centimeter is about the width of your thumbnail , or whatever , \[ and , \+ you know , and \] leaving it at that E_S ###and , uh , you know , a kilogram weighs about this much E_S ###and * get used to it from scratch , E_S 
58248:8	###and , uh , you know , a kilogram weighs about this much E_S ###and * get used to it from scratch , E_S ###cause I still ca n't convert back and forth from inches to centimeters E_S ###but I 'm perfectly comfortable *-1 using either . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###And I think 0 the real problem with \[ this , \+ this \] weird conversion , \[ yo- , \+ you \] see signs that *T*-1 say fifty-five miles per hour and , you know , whatever it would be *T*-2 one hundred six kilometers per hour , you know , N_S ###people , you know , N_S ###it *EXP*-1 's hard * to take it seriously . E_S 
58248:100	###and , uh , you know , a kilogram weighs about this much E_S ###and * get used to it from scratch , E_S ###cause I still ca n't convert back and forth from inches to centimeters E_S ###but I 'm perfectly comfortable *-1 using either .

E_S ###SpeakerB24 . 
58295:18	###* Remember me getting a package of something that *T*-1 said one pound , E_S ###this is a package of dates mind you , E_S ###\[ it 's , \+ was , \] presumably something 0 you weigh *T*-1 fairly precisely , E_S ###it said one pound E_S ###and then in parenthesis it said four hundred fifty-four point six grams . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###And , as near as I could tell , * seeing that was basically anti-metric propaganda E_S 
58362:20	###a little more attention to human psychology E_S ###and , whereas , people want round numbers N_S ###and after all , the whole reason 0 * to go over to metric *T*-1 is * to have round numbers , ###so they do n't deal with thirty seconds of an inch E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Exactly , E_S ###exactly . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###and so what the exact , N_S ###the thing that *T*-1 was best about metric was the thing that *T*-2 was most poorly represented . E_S 
58387:165	###SpeakerB62 . ###Right . E_S ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###SpeakerB64 . ###That 's true . E_S ###Well , * sure have enjoyed our talk . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Yes , E_S ###well * get back to what you 're doing *T*-1 E_S 
58451:6	###he put himself through college *-1 working in restaurants . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###Oh , wow . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###And , uh , he 's much better cook than I am *?* , E_S ###so , when I was home *T*-1 I still cooked a lot E_S ###and I was in to a lot of vegetarian stuff . E_S ###And now , I went back to work about a year and a half ago E_S ###so , one of the things that he took over *T*-1 was the cooking E_S ###and the kids are thrilled , E_S 
58486:15	###SpeakerA26 . ###I was just going *-1 to say , 0 * makes a difference in what you eat *T*-2 does n't it . E_S ###Or are you not at that stage yet ? E_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it does . E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB29 . ###We try our hardest *-3 to get them to eat what we , \[ w- , \+ \] eat *T*-2 , you know . E_S 
58551:30	###SpeakerA50 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB51 . ###but , uh , \[ i- , \+ it \] was basically just ground up Swiss cheese and then , uh , standard cream sauce base and then , uh the scallops . E_S ###SpeakerA52 . ###Really , E_S ###with scallops . E_S ###SpeakerB53 . ###\[ An , \+ and \] it sounds sort of funny E_S 
58705:13	###but \[ it just , \+ it \] was a tremendous amount of cooking . E_S ###Because you do have *-1 to make * sure 0 you have the right combinations of different proteins to make * sure 0 they 're complete , E_S ###SpeakerB101 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA102 . ###and we had little kids at the time , you know , E_S ###when I was home with them *T*-1 , and \[ it , \+ it \] was just so much cooking , E_S ###\[ I could n't , \+ I do n't \] like *-1 to cook . E_S ###SpeakerB103 . ###SpeakerA104 . 
58880:14	###and I went to U V A , E_S ###that 's where we went *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB153 . ###Oh , oh really . E_S ###SpeakerA154 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB155 . ###Yeah E_S ###\[ I went to school at , \+ uh , well I went to school at \] West Virginia University , E_S 
58921:20	###SpeakerB165 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###We were saying 0 we could sell our house here and buy one down there ###cash , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA166 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ you probably could *?* , \+ ###you probably could *?* , \] E_S ###SpeakerB167 . 
58972:102	###SpeakerB12 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###They ca n't even afford *-1 to take off , you know , *-2 to have children it seems like *T*-3 .

E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . 
58979:95	###SpeakerA15 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###\[ And , \+ uh , because \] if you have , you know , two , well , if you go to work , you 're , just working *-1 to pay for day care , ###two or three , you know , um . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###SpeakerA19 . ###Now , I was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where \[ when my kids were , \+ you know , when I had them *T*-1 and when they were small *T*-2 , \] until \[ they got in junior high school , \+ my youngest got in junior high , \] I did n't have *-3 to work *T*-4 . E_S 
59001:20	###She just had her fourth one in , uh , March E_S ###and she does n't have *-1 to work either . E_S ###I do n't know how they do it *T*-1 .

59073:8	###SpeakerB48 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###I said my goodness , what is it , lined *-1 in gold , you know , uh . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###But \[ it is , \+ it 's \] getting worse , E_S ###and , if I 'd of probably had three or four children , I do n't see how *T*-2 we could have made it , you know , without me working *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . 
59129:61	###now my daughter , there 's no way that she can imagine herself married at the age that she 's at *T*-1 now *T*-2 .

E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###\[ where , \+ now when \] I graduated high school *T*-1 , the thing , N_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###\[ That 's , you did , \+ that 's what you did *T*-1 . \] Uh . E_S

E_S 
59222:20	###SpeakerB96 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###And I think that more and more the attitude 's getting that \[ a \+ \] way .

63063:71	###SpeakerA95 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###So , you know , \[ you , not only , \+ you know , you 're not only \] doing something *-1 to keep yourself fit , but you 're probably prolonging your life . E_S ###So .

63176:53	###I 've never done that one before . E_S ###But . N_S ###SpeakerB134 . ###Oh , you have a pool there , too ? E_S ###SpeakerA135 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB136 . ###Oh , how nice . E_S ###SpeakerA137 . ###They 've got an olympic pool , \[ and , \+ and \] basketball courts and sand volleyball . E_S 
63331:9	###but , you know , it 's like somebody said , okay as of such and such a date , you know , anybody caught * talking in the English , you know , will be shot *-1 or something like that , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###SpeakerA33 . ###But , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Well , thing is , 0 it 's a \[ global , \+ global \] market place these days , E_S ###and , you know , we 're like , what , one of two backwards countries in the world , as far as , N_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I read that , what Uganda and , N_S 
63337:9	###and , you know , we 're like , what , one of two backwards countries in the world , as far as , N_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I read that , what Uganda and , N_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Something . E_S ###I do n't remember what the other one is *T*-1 E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###There 's one or two others that *T*-1 just , N_S 
63428:6	###SpeakerB68 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###SpeakerB70 . ###I would have \[ more problem \+ more problem \] with the temperature , except that , you know , *-1 working in engineering , we do everything in Centigrade , or Celsius . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###SpeakerB72 . ###SpeakerA73 . ###Well , I had kind of gotten used to centigrade temperature , you know , E_S ###if it 's between zero and ten , it 's cold , E_S 
63445:31	###You know , you do n't get all the little differences E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's about . N_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###you know , the differences between seventy and seventy-two or seventy-five degrees is n't much , E_S ###but the difference thirty and thirty-five degrees is , quite a bit . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###* Is about twice as much , what it works out to *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . 
63513:18	###The only thing that *T*-1 was in it \[ was \+ built * in the U S was \] the , uh , differential , E_S ###and it was built *-1 in Buffalo , New York . E_S ###But it 's got the hardest combination of , uh , metric E_S ###and , most of the body parts seem *-1 to be metric , E_S ###and most of the engine parts seem *-1 to be S A E , E_S ###so . It 's just crazy . E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###Right . E_S ###It just gets bad , E_S ###now , \[ you got *-1 to , \+ you got *-2 to \] have one , and not mix them up . E_S 
63542:13	###you 'd have people going , you 're right , a hundred miles an hour . E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###And , so . I do n't know , E_S ###I 'd kind of , N_S ###and the other thing , too , is 0 , you know , between here and El Paso 's , what , five hundred miles , E_S ###but it 's almost eight hundred kilometers , you know . E_S ###That 'd sure seems like a long way . E_S ###SpeakerB106 . 
63561:17	###they could 've converted it to metric just about as easy . E_S ###SpeakerB110 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 they , N_S ###you got the problem with all your cars are still , N_S ###yeah , E_S ###you still got cars on the road that *T*-2 do n't have both . E_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB112 . 
63732:23	###That was a shocker to me . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well there are a lot of things that *T*-1 are n't *?* , E_S ###I 'm , N_S ###that 's , uh , one of the things 0 I wonder about *T*-1 , E_S ###uh , one of the questions was , do you think 0 more *ICH*-2 should be done *-1 , or something else . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] wonder about some of the \[ prod- , \+ products \] that they do n't take *T*-1 , like some of the plastics and things that they do n't take *T*-2 . Uh , \[ why , \+ why \] they could n't do more recycling with those *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Well , I was in , uh , Bizmart the other day , E_S 
63766:8	###SpeakerB64 . ###Now , see that 's recycling , you know , E_S ###companies that *T*-1 do at least go into it , E_S I 'd like *-1 to see subsidy by the government or something , or tax-wise or something , heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###So that people would use this stuff \[ re- , \+ \] over again . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's a good idea . E_S 
63811:44	###SpeakerB82 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###and this is kind of an unusual use for that type of thing . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###You know they 're , N_S ###along that same line , they said 0 they were using , um , N_S ###what is , ###oh , I know , N_S ###it was toilets . 
63849:10	###and then I forget *-1 to bring them in the store . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###I 'm forever going back out to my car *-1 to pick up my bags *-2 to bring them and take my garbage back out . E_S ###I wish 0 they 'd really push this recycling bit , because \[ I never realized , \+ I really did n't realize \] how much stuff I actually throw *T*-1 away . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###Well , I think 0 \[ the , \+ the \] more 0 people are aware of it *T*-1 , \[ the , \+ the \] more they 'll do *T*-2 . E_S ###I think 0 that 's just the biggest problem is keeping it \[ in , \+ in \] front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is *T*-1 , and how important it *EXP*-3 is *T*-2 * to do that . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . 
63858:90	###SpeakerB98 . ###You know what I 'd like *-1 to see *T*-2 a little more . N_S ###I do n't have any little tiny kids , E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now , in five years , when they get bigger *T*-1 , it 'll work a little bit more , too . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . 
64030:9	###SpeakerB59 . ###No , E_S ###no . E_S ###SpeakerA60 . ###Not in the Spring . E_S ###SpeakerB61 . ###Right . E_S ###I have *-1 to think every year *-4 to try *-5 to remember \[ what it was , \+ what 's it supposed \] *-2 to like *T*-3 this time of year . E_S ###SpeakerA62 . ###Spring is nice . E_S 
64040:4	###SpeakerB63 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Because March we usually get a lot of rain , in March , you know . E_S ###It 'll seem the news , the Harold Taft , you know , on the local news . E_S ###SpeakerA64 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB65 . ###March we typically get a lot of rain , E_S ###and we 've had this many inches , E_S ###and , you know , we 're right on target , you know , E_S 
64143:27	###I said , Okay , you know E_S ###SpeakerB99 . ###Uh-huh .

64165:61	###SpeakerB107 . ###Right .

64729:34	###SpeakerB112 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA113 . ###So , N_S ###SpeakerB114 . ###Right . E_S ###Yep . E_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###But \[ if you do , \+ if you do \] have *-1 to go something , I guess 0 we can just cut off . E_S ###SpeakerB116 . 
65105:69	###SpeakerA15 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###And , uh , but , uh , I do n't read a lot of nonfiction , E_S ###and I really should *?* because there 's so many self-improvement books out right now that *T*-1 \[ would , \+ would \] \[ be , \+ \] benefit me greatly , E_S ###but I just do n't .

E_S ###SpeakerB32 . 
65282:8	###but , um , I was mostly interested in the baseball stuff . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###So you 're probably , uh , a Baltimore fan *ICH*-1 , right , an Oriole fan ? E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Uh , actually I 'm a Red Sox fan more than anything . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Is that right ? E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . 
65434:29	###then we usually sit out there . E_S ###SpeakerA127 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB128 . ###SpeakerA129 . ###Well how much are the box seats there *T*-1 ? E_S ###Do you know offhand ?

65577:9	###\[ I have , \+ I have \] a son that *T*-1 just turned sixteen , E_S ###SpeakerA181 . ###Uh-huh .

65997:42	###SpeakerA56 . ###Right . E_S ###Well , you know , the way 0 the economy 's going *T*-1 and inflation and the recession and all that , I think 0 \[ we , \+ we \] really need *-2 to try *-3 to stay out of debt as much as possible .

66082:57	###SpeakerB87 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA88 . ###SpeakerB89 . ###Oh , okay .

E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###So I said , well , gee , this is pretty much like Texas . E_S ###And it pretty much is *?* in the middle of Summer .

E_S ###SpeakerA83 . 
69954:21	###you can lay on the beach all 0 you want *?* *T*-1 , E_S ###but if you want *-1 to go *-3 wind suffering or diving or swimming , you have *-2 to wear a wet suit .

69961:46	###It 's never humid or sticky or salty feeling , E_S ###so I really like that about this area .

70008:18	###SpeakerA133 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Their Springs and Summers are pretty mild , too . E_S ###It never gets real , real hot . E_S ###SpeakerB134 . ###Uh-huh .

70030:4	###But , anyway . Well , N_S ###SpeakerA139 . ###Well , as we were talking the weather came on E_S ###and there 's a flash flood watch and , more rain for the next three or four days .

72559:18	###we 're having a terrible time with the recession . E_S ###SpeakerA147 . ###Really ? E_S ###SpeakerB148 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###It 's not good at all . E_S ###SpeakerA149 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB150 . 
72633:61	###It 's because they ca n't read . E_S ###SpeakerA175 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it *EXP*-4 's really surprising how many people *ICH*-2 *T*-1 graduate from high school , \[ and \+ \] that I work with *T*-3 N_S ###SpeakerB176 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA177 . ###and people , I mean , N_S ###I get memos all the time across my desk E_S ###and things are misspelled *-1 E_S 
72657:27	###SpeakerA185 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB186 . ###because , uh , I think 0 even mentally when you can do some , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###I do n't , E_S ###* guess 0 we got our first , uh , credit card , oh , back in the \[ seventies , \+ early seventies \] when , I first got married *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . 
72702:48	###SpeakerB20 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###SpeakerB22 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###and it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . 
72713:25	###SpeakerB26 . ###SpeakerA27 . ###I kind of like *-1 having them for , uh , gasoline purchases . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Yeah , E_S ###we like *-1 to keep one on hand just for emergencies , you know . E_S ###But , N_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Yeah . E_S ###But other than that , uh , \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 over the years * tried *-1 to avoid the national credit card syndrome , of * just putting everything on there day after day after day E_S 
72818:29	###SpeakerB76 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###so , you 're a little bit more careful about what you put *T*-1 on that , even though you can use it however you want *-2 to *?* *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###SpeakerA79 . ###SpeakerB80 . ###Can you use that one for personal use ? E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S

73123:45	###and you mature I suppose 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###But the thing about the child care \[ I , \+ you know , I \] have friends that *T*-1 struggle financially ###\[ and , \+ and \] they both do have *-2 to work . E_S ###It 's a matter *ICH*-2 not necessarily , uh , that she *ICH*-3 might want *-1 to stay home or he , as well , E_S ###but , you know , they need the money . E_S ###And , uh , when I seen some of my friends that *T*-1 have taken that six week old baby , you know , to someone else *T*-2 , it 's just , I can imagine how emotional it must be *T*-3 . ###\[ \[ And , \+ and , \] \+ \] you know , * multiplied *-4 by the fact that you do n't really trust the person or you 're uncomfortable with the situation MUMBLEx , as far as child care , um , E_S ###it 's just a scary thing . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Well , we were lucky when our children were that age *T*-1 , E_S 
73175:55	###I think 0 that might be part of the problem with some people .

E_S ###I 'm sure 0 that 's a whole new ball game . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###SpeakerB80 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I have a nine year old that I would trade *T*-1 happily for a baby MUMBLEx . E_S 
73305:43	###SpeakerA129 . ###Well , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I 'm \] living in a dream world , E_S ###what do I know *T*-1 . E_S ###As I said , I do n't have kids E_S ###and I 'm an only child E_S ###so I 've never been around children . E_S ###So , uh , I 'm sort of at a loss where that 's concerned *-1 *T*-2 . E_S ###But I do hear my friends talk about it . E_S ###SpeakerB130 . ###\[ We , \+ we 're \] having such fun , E_S 
73339:8	###And so they just sort of , you know , adopted me as their eleventh child E_S ###so that worked out pretty well . E_S ###She never had *-1 to worry about *-3 taking anybody to child care because there was always somebody there older 0 *T*-2 to deal with them , E_S ###so I guess , 0 that 's an alternative . E_S ###If you could just , um , have a whole bunch . E_S ###SpeakerB138 . ###* Have enough . E_S ###SpeakerA139 . ###SpeakerB140 . ###SpeakerA141 . 
73405:8	###but , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Well , it seems to me that civic freedoms are more restricted E_S ###but that may just be because I 've changed . E_S ###You know , I used *-1 to live up north . E_S ###Down here , Dallas , * seems to me , 0 the police are militant E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Really . E_S 
73446:4	###SpeakerA27 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###I agree . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###and maybe that has a lot 0 * to do *T*-1 with it . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] definitely think 0 that has gotten a lot worse , E_S ###and you know , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 there 's , N_S ###to me there seems *-1 to be a little bit of a decline in the family values . E_S 
73625:6	###SpeakerB94 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , seventh floor . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###Yeah , E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###T A D , E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###Well , uh , \[ he , \+ uh , boy , he \] comes up there and gives us all kinds of grief .

73650:4	###I do n't know , E_S ###I guess 0 if this is the only place 0 you 've lived *T*-1 , Lubbock is a lot different than Dallas . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###Yeah , E_S ###flat , dry and dirty , E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###SpeakerA105 . ###Yeah , E_S 
73652:51	###SpeakerB102 . ###Yeah , E_S ###flat , dry and dirty , E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###SpeakerA105 . ###Yeah , E_S ###but the people all seem *-1 to be a lot more laid back , too , E_S ###I mean , here in Dallas everything is just real rush , rush . E_S 
73662:23	###SpeakerB106 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I lived in the country for several years , E_S ###and * living in the city is a whole different uh , social structure E_S ###SpeakerA107 . ###Oh yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB108 . ###but , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###Well , I got some friends that , uh , N_S

E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###\[ And , \+ uh , and \] there have been many things that *T*-1 have happened that *T*-2 have not encouraged closeness of families and , uh , support for young people \[ that \+ \] the kind of support that they need *T*-3 , *-4 to help them take care of the things , E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Yes , E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###if you do n't have some kind \[ of , \+ of \] basic believe or something down inside of you , then it *EXP*-1 's very difficult * to , uh , have anything 0 * to turn to *T*-2 , \[ when you got , \+ when you 've got \] something facing you like that *T*-3 . E_S 
73904:27	###SpeakerA67 . ###Yeah E_S ###exactly . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###You \[ can \+ as a teacher , ca n't \] hold a child accountable , if you 're not going *-1 to get reinforced *-2 by , that at home . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###SpeakerA71 . ###That 's right . E_S 
73947:12	###um , E_S the kinds of jobs that people need *-1 to be trained * , for *T*-2 now . N_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###Uh , you know , with farming being so mechanized , uh , people working on the family farm which *T*-1 was a traditional American way that becomes less and less likely , E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###factory jobs are so much more , um , uh , sophisticated . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . 
74000:8	###SpeakerB112 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA113 . ###\[ I think \+ \[ as , uh , \+ as , \] uh , mother you know , I use *-1 to think \] sometimes 0 \[ it 's not so much , \+ uh , it 's not so much \] the kids , E_S ###it 's just the volume of it , * to try *-1 to keep all wash done and all the things done \[ and , \+ you know , and \] everything .

74056:38	###SpeakerA133 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB134 . ###and it keeps me from *-1 being the old fogy E_S ###so , but at the same time , it also it prevents kids from *-1 try *-2 to go *-3 pull the wool over your eyes , E_S ###SpeakerA135 . ###SpeakerB136 . ###SpeakerA137 . ###Yes , E_S ###I think 0 that 's true . E_S 
74166:24	###SpeakerA4 . ###And I think 0 a lot of it has *-1 to do with the fact that we do n't train our teachers very well .

E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###SpeakerA6 . ###SpeakerB7 . ###SpeakerA8 . ###They 're social services . E_S ###SpeakerB9 . 
74293:134	###You know , if there 's some gauge that they could make *T*-1 . N_S ###SpeakerA60 . ###Yeah .

74310:52	###SpeakerB65 . ###I thought that maybe something .

74346:18	###SpeakerA82 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB83 . ###And , you know , the whole electronic classroom idea .

75533:28	###SpeakerB114 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 that 's re- , N_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###SpeakerB116 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA117 . ###SpeakerB118 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA119 . 
75545:20	###SpeakerB120 . ###That 's awful . E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###and he goes out and commits it again . E_S ###Fact , he 's back in jail now . E_S ###So , \[ what , \+ what , \] uh , N_S ###SpeakerB122 . ###* Gives you sympathy for the vigilantes . E_S ###SpeakerA123 . ###Yeah . E_S 
75556:21	###SpeakerB124 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA125 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 \[ in our , \+ in our \] particular neighborhood , vigilantism is becoming a \[ real , \+ real \] possibility .

75646:69	###And they lose their constitutional rights . E_S ###SpeakerA163 . ###Uh-huh .

75712:59	###I mean you can get things for such a song . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###So , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] really why we ended up in a house like this *T*-1 .

76289:46	###SpeakerB64 . ###Yeah .

77973:25	###SpeakerB86 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###It 's a nice area . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###It 's , means 0 they have *-1 to drive a little bit , E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###Yeah , E_S 
77993:23	###because she had been called *-1 back up , ###active duty . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###yeah .

78339:76	###SpeakerB136 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA137 . ###SpeakerB138 . ###\[ He , \+ he \] does that quite a bit . E_S ###SpeakerA139 . ###And , N_S ###SpeakerB140 . ###\[ He , \+ he \] has n't lately , though , uh , because he 's been ill , E_S ###SpeakerA141 . 
78363:99	###Johnstown and , uh , \[ in s- , \+ in that \] area is just really neat , E_S ###interesting things 0 * to N_S ###so , you know . N_S ###SpeakerB144 . ###Uh-huh .

78403:14	###If you 're , you know , N_S ###SpeakerB160 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA161 . ###once they get a little bigger , not teeny tiny ones , N_S ###but , \[ even , \+ even \] some little ones do pretty good E_S ###\[ but , \+ but \] when they get a little bigger *T*-1 \[ so \+ \] they can help , E_S ###SpeakerB162 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA163 . 
78477:8	###and so I hardly ever have anybody that *T*-1 wins that I vote for *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Oh , liberal , E_S ###\[ by , \+ what do you mean *T*-1 by \] liberal , um . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Liberal politically , E_S ###I 'm , you know , like pretty left wing \[ Demo- , \+ Democrat , \] E_S ###so .

78525:10	###they want less government involvement , in society E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Huh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###So , E_S 
78750:48	###SpeakerB112 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA113 . ###\[ if , \+ since \] you 're what , Democrat ? Then like your kids or whatever will follow you and just vote Democrat , E_S ###SpeakerB114 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###right . E_S ###SpeakerB116 . 
78833:14	###it just depends on how well you can hide it *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA149 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB150 . ###You know , and I , N_S ###that 's very true , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 that does n't really have that much 0 *T*-1 to do with , um , unless they 've done something really horrible , you know , or something real abnormal . E_S ###SpeakerA151 . ###Well , E_S ###SpeakerB152 . 
79029:11	###where I work *T*-2 they also have recycling *ICH*-1 there of , uh , all white paper and of , you know , cans also E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###so , I mean , a lot of people , you know , right at the vending machines , they have receptacles that , you know , you can just pop your cans in *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
79245:21	###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###The cat is , N_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###he 's the little boy Pomeranian . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Oh , my goodness . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###And we just got a new addition to the family , so * to speak , E_S

79578:38	###or , N_S ###SpeakerA119 . ###No , E_S ###they do n't , E_S ###no . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] glanced at the clock when , um , we started *T*-1 E_S ###and I think 0 it 's been probably about five and a half minutes or something .

E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###SpeakerB12 . ###Do you have a lot of credit cards ? E_S 
79792:51	###SpeakerB48 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###so \[ \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ uh , it 's , \] \+ uh , it 's \] a really big problem I think , and , um , takes mature people *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] treat it , uh , E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Yeah .

81133:6	###SpeakerB92 . ###Yeah E_S ###she 's , N_S ###this one , N_S ###you know 0 PRETTY WOMAN was kind of a light comedy and a romance , E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###\[ and , \+ and \] this one was a lot more dramatic . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . 
81245:9	###and Christopher Reeve , or , Mike Douglas went after his throat , you dummy . E_S ###SpeakerB134 . ###SpeakerA135 . ###So I know that they die , E_S ###but I have n't told my husband .

81275:8	###and one 's in the middle of the other , E_S ###so we could do it . E_S ###SpeakerB144 . ###That would n't be too bad . E_S ###SpeakerA145 . ###No , E_S ###and he could climb out the window . E_S ###SpeakerB146 . ###SpeakerA147 . ###Wh- , N_S 
81287:6	###so we can , you know N_S ###SpeakerB148 . ###Get around . E_S ###SpeakerA149 . ###yeah , E_S ###you can get around . E_S ###You just ca n't go out the front door honey , E_S ###sorry . E_S ###SpeakerB150 . ###Well did you see FATAL ATTRACTION ? E_S

81429:19	###why do n't you tell me about yours *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###Okay , E_S ###I live in Plano , in a four bedroom , two bath house , which *T*-1 is ###the area 's dominantly three bedroom , two bath . E_S ###So , I 'm just a little bit different than typical , uh , E_S ###and of course , the Plano area is basically with alleyways , E_S ###so everything around here is set *-1 up that way . Which I think 0 *T*-4 is a little bit different than most areas , in the houses , the way 0 they 're constructed *-3 *T*-2 . E_S ###And it 's a brick house , with , uh , some wood . E_S ###It 's real nice , E_S 
81436:18	###so everything around here is set *-1 up that way . Which I think 0 *T*-4 is a little bit different than most areas , in the houses , the way 0 they 're constructed *-3 *T*-2 . E_S ###And it 's a brick house , with , uh , some wood . E_S ###It 's real nice , E_S ###I like it . E_S ###How about you ? E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Well \[ I , \+ I \] certainly hope so . E_S ###We have \[ a , \+ a \] classic ranch , up in Denton .

81476:17	###and I can pick it out again because it 's not typical , E_S ###\[ is \+ \] I 've got the , oh , ###what do you call a , uh , double ceiling , double high in one half of the house *T*-1 . E_S ###So like the den and the living room are all double cathedral ceilings . E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###Uh , cathedral ceilings . E_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###And , uh , the kitchen is norm E_S ###and the bedrooms are norm . E_S ###So it just goes down the dining room , the family room , and the living room that way . E_S 
81484:15	###and the bedrooms are norm . E_S ###So it just goes down the dining room , the family room , and the living room that way . E_S ###And I love the space . E_S ###\[ It just , \+ it 's , \] uh , N_S ###luckily I came from a house in Colorado which *T*-1 had the cathedral ceiling E_S ###and I just lucked out and walked into this one E_S ###and of course I felt the same airy feeling , which I liked *T*-1 it real well , E_S ###so it *EXP*-1 's a nice thing * to move into , E_S ###but , again , it 's not typical in this area . E_S ###You can just spot them because \[ the ce- , \+ the roof \] is so \[ hi- , \+ much higher . \] E_S 
81502:24	###SpeakerB15 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###He can walk E_S ###and he 's six foot . E_S ###And he says , oh , * come on up mom . ###I 'm not going up there . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###SpeakerA18 . ###I 'm not going up there , E_S 
81578:14	###I mean * just do n't run too fast , E_S ###or you 'll hit it E_S ###and I 'm not used to that either . E_S ###I mean I could see people *ICH*-1 putting swimming pools in the back yard all around me , E_S ###but to me , you put the swimming pool in your back yard E_S ###and you 've lost your back yard . E_S ###SpeakerB33 . ###Entirely . E_S ###SpeakerA34 . ###I mean , uh , sure , E_S 
81713:11	###SpeakerA27 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###It 's further west than Georgia , E_S ###it 's , uh , right below Virginia . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Okay . E_S ###Well , Kentucky 's next to Virginia , I 'm pretty sure 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###Well , I 'm from Kentucky , E_S ###I should know E_S 
81734:20	###They freak out when there 's snow on the ground *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Originally I 'm from Texas E_S ###so , I mean Amarillo . E_S ###So , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Oh , Amarillo ? E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
81783:6	###SpeakerB52 . ###Actually , they 've been doing the same thing here .

E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Well , you know 0 what they 've started *-1 doing *T*-2 \[ is , \+ is \] 0 instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses they 've started *-3 putting them up at the top , E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###Uh-huh .

82131:11	###and he got me into it . E_S ###SpeakerB176 . ###Oh , I see . E_S ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA177 . ###How 'd you get into it *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB178 . ###Um , \[ I , \+ I \] was taking a voice I O class \[ and , \+ um , and \] actually doing some research , E_S ###and so they told me about this project . E_S ###SpeakerA179 . 
82157:8	###No . E_S ###SpeakerB186 . ###Uh , no , E_S ###Boston 's above . E_S ###SpeakerA187 . ###Boston , Massachusetts . E_S ###SpeakerB188 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA189 . ###But I 've talked to people in New York , E_S 
82535:14	###SpeakerA120 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB121 . ###So , yeah , E_S ###\[ that \+ that 's \] a tough situation , E_S ###but \[ then , \+ then \] again , you know , some , N_S ###you got *-1 to do what you got *-3 to do *T*-2 , you know *-1 to get along , too , E_S ###SpeakerA122 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB123 . 
82698:4	###And then we further complicate it by *-1 saying , you know , 0 we will keep the polls open until eight o'clock . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###What ... N_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###SpeakerB16 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###\[ Most people , \+ uh , a great number of people \] now work \[ at various , \+ at different \] jobs that , ###if a third of the people are shift workers , they wo n't be able *-1 to get \[ to the , \+ to the \] polls in any case . If they , uh , have *-2 to work late into the evening and not get up . E_S ###My solution to that is that we hold it on Sundays .

82754:6	###but other states you have *-1 to register every couple of years . \[ And , \+ \] uh ... Well , \[ \[ * to vote , \+ * to vote , \] \+ *-2 to just vote . \] E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###SpeakerB42 . ###* To absentee vote specifically ? E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###SpeakerB44 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . 
82786:8	###SpeakerB54 . ###Right . E_S ###I think 0 that is the biggest one . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###I ... N_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###That 's the biggest problem . E_S ###I ... N_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Well , that 's diminished *-1 by , N_S 
82866:4	###SpeakerB84 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###but they do n't throw the rascal *ICH*-1 out , their own rascal . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###Uh , \[ my , \+ my \] solution \[ to , \+ to \] part of this \[ is , \+ is \] * \[ to , \+ to \] make it \[ a-a-an , \+ an \] economic incentive for people to vote . E_S ###That sounds rather crass , I think , because \[ then , \+ then \] you are saying , well , uh , y-y-you know , ###\[ y- , \+ \[ in- , y-y , \+ \] \] 
82900:8	###a-a-and we have *-2 to make it *EXP*-1 as easy as possible for him to get to the polls .

82912:77	###\[ any , \+ \[ th- , \+ they \] do not promise anything \] specific these days . E_S ###But whatever you are promised *-1 *T*-2 , \[ they just , \+ they just \] reverse themselves depending on who *T*-3 pays them what once they get into office . E_S ###I mean , I think 0 that 's the ... N_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###Well , * read my lips . ###\[ \[ And , \+ and , \] \+ and \] no new taxes E_S ###and yet Bush did that . E_S ###\[ \[ But \+ I mean , but \] \+ but \] he 's excused *-1 from that . E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###Yeah . E_S 
82957:61	###SpeakerB116 . ###SpeakerA117 . ###And he is motivated because we happen *-1 to be the cradle of liberty and all that . E_S ###I think 0 voters are motivated , uh ... E_S ###SpeakerB118 . ###\[ What about , \+ what about \] voters in the other countries that you were talking about *T*-1 ? E_S ###Like in the European countries where they have higher turnouts *T*-1 ?

82972:19	###I think 0 England has about a seventy percent , sixty-five percent turn out . E_S ###SpeakerB122 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA123 . ###I think that we just discovered \[ in this , \+ \[ in , \+ in \] the \] Indian elections is \[ th- , \+ one of the \] \[ greatest \+ greatest \] and massive things \[ in , \+ in \] the world .

82973:14	###SpeakerB122 . ###Uh-huh .

82986:69	###And the corruption of politics \[ \[ in , \+ in , \] \+ in \] that s-s-situation there . E_S ###SpeakerB128 . ###Oh , really ? E_S ###SpeakerA129 . ###SpeakerB130 . ###SpeakerA131 . ###SpeakerB132 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA133 . ###SpeakerB134 . 
82999:45	###SpeakerB136 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA137 . ###I mean is , N_S ###\[ but , \+ but \] \[ before these enormous , \+ before this \] Voting Rights Act , what we had *T*-1 was \[ a , \+ a \] great deal of our population , uh , mainly the blacks in the south and the Hispanics were precluded *-2 \[ by , \+ by , \] uh , voting laws , uh , \[ from * reg- , \+ from their eligibility * to register . \] E_S ###SpeakerB138 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA139 . ###SpeakerB140 . ###Oh . E_S 
83011:7	###SpeakerB142 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA143 . ###So , if you really computed it , they probably N_S ###when we said 0 we had a seventy percent turnout in nineteen fifty *T*-1 , we really only had a fifty percent turnout E_S ###because all the eligible voters N_S ###SpeakerB144 . ###Oh , I see , E_S ###because , ###right . N_S 
83075:32	###SpeakerA1 . ###Well , uh , it seems to me \[ that , \+ uh , that \] N_S ###I do not know whether the jury system , uh , N_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] should not say 0 I do not know . E_S ###I do not feel very , uh , stronger that the jury system should be changed *-1 . E_S ###It seems *-1 to have worked , uh , time immemorial . E_S ###And when , uh , difficult decisions , uh , are made *-1 *T*-2 , uh , uh , uh , they generally prove out *-3 to be right by things that *T*-4 occur later on . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . 
83086:64	###And indeed some juries are no longer twelve people , E_S ###they are down to \[ as little , \+ as small \] as six people \[ \[ \[ in , \+ I think , in \] petty , \] \+ \[ \[ \[ in , \+ in , \] \+ uh , in , \] uh , in \] minor \] felonies , \[ and , \+ uh , and \] misdemeanor trials . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh , I think that the judges should be left *-1 to do most of the sentencing , simply because , uh , \[ there is always , \+ uh , \[ there is , \+ there is \] always \] a jury that *T*-2 might be swayed *-3 , uh , by the moment , uh , * \[ to \+ either to \] be too lenient or too vengeful , I guess 0 *T*-5 . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###SpeakerA7 . ###SpeakerB8 . ###Yeah . E_S 
83132:96	###SpeakerB28 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###and indeed the present overcrowding conditions , uh , prevail . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###SpeakerA31 . ###Plus , I guess , 0 there was some credit for time 0 this guy had already spent in jail * waiting for trial *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . 
83241:31	###SpeakerA69 . ###Uh , and yet \[ \[ there are , \+ there are so many , \] \+ there are so many \] people in prison . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###You know , people that , N_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###I mean the prison population , uh , as far as \[ I , \+ I , \] uh , you know , N_S ###my impression of it is \[ that it has , \+ that it has \] doubled in the last ten years and tripled in the last twenty . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . 
83241:44	###SpeakerA69 . ###Uh , and yet \[ \[ there are , \+ there are so many , \] \+ there are so many \] people in prison .

83253:33	###But \[ there , \+ there \] definitely is , uh , uh , you know , to me \[ the , \+ one of the \] worst things that *T*-1 could ever happen , uh , from what I read and see and understand *T*-2 .

E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###I mean it would be very difficult , E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###Well , I would be interested in *-2 finding out what the , uh , percentage of drug related type things are *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###SpeakerB78 . 
83276:80	###I mean , I do not , N_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###I imagine 0 there is a \[ certain , \+ certain \] right *ICH*-1 of the press * to have the ability * to ask that .

E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Well , I know , uh , E_S ###on the other hand though , when , uh- , after the Barry trial , up here , you know , the big local trial , as well as national . N_S ###SpeakerA87 . 
83310:23	###We want *-1 to see , E_S ###I do not know what they wanted *T*-1 honestly . E_S ###Did they want the guy to , ###I do not know .

E_S ###\[ I think , \+ I , \] N_S ###no doubt in my mind the federal government picked him out and selected him to be prosecuted *-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###Oh , I felt that way .

83758:9	###I live in town . E_S ###But * just pulling all the weeds out of that just drives me nuts . E_S ###I do not like it .

84680:14	###SpeakerB187 . ###SpeakerA188 . ###You know , it is just , ###I think 0 kids get too much too fast . And all those sort of things . E_S ###SpeakerB189 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA190 . ###SpeakerB191 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA192 . 
84722:80	###How do you feel about it *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , yeah , E_S ###I feel much the same way . E_S ###I 've , uh , two kids right now E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###one is two and a half E_S ###and one 's nine months , E_S 
84777:127	###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . ###Yeah , E_S ###we 've , uh , gone through that , uh , E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###SpeakerA23 . ###I remember 0 my parents did n't do all those type things , E_S ###and so I made a special effort *ICH*-1 with my children * to do things like that .

E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###SpeakerA39 . ###So , we 're kind of far apart here . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . 
84892:11	###SpeakerA7 . ###Um , that is n't the same in the Washington area because we do n't have any major , um , industry except for , uh , government and services . E_S ###And \[ the , \+ the \] transportation situation is such that , uh , all the car pollution \[ is , \+ is \] absolutely awful . E_S ###Um , also the \[ worth of the \+ \] hub of three airports N_S ###in this general area there is , uh , National , Dulles , and then , uh , Baltimore , Washington .

84895:25	###Um , also the \[ worth of the \+ \] hub of three airports N_S ###in this general area there is , uh , National , Dulles , and then , uh , Baltimore , Washington .

84975:61	###SpeakerB36 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###I mean this is \[ so , \+ so \] basic . E_S ###It 's human rights in the sense , E_S ###but , uh , in terms of * demanding , it 's just not caused N_S ###but demanding that , uh , we can spend so much money on certain things but that research really be directed *-1 toward , um , improvement of polluting vehicles , and not just cars but also buses , um , planes . That something can be done *-2 . ###I me- , I ca n't imagine that well , E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Well , \[ I , \+ I \] th- , N_S 
85013:15	###SpeakerA49 . ###That 's right . E_S ###Well , and also * to make it economically feasible . ###Uh , and \[ per- , \+ \] \[ ti- , \+ \] also in buses . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###That 's right . E_S ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###I do n't know if you ever got caught *-1 in a traffic jam behind a bus , E_S ###SpeakerB52 . 
85029:51	###\[ and \+ but , \] you know , I was reading the other day * not to go on with this but that , diesel fumes actually have less pollutants in them than gasoline fumes . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###SpeakerA57 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###So , I guess 0 you 're better off *-1 sitting behind a bus than a car although \[ I can never , \+ I could never , \] uh , really \[ \[ a- , \+ a- , \] \+ \] rationalize that while I was sitting there . E_S 
85086:25	###SpeakerB80 . ###No . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###Uh , so \[ you 've , *-1 to lo- , \+ you 've got *-2 to look \] elsewhere . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###\[ So , \+ uh , but \] it is something that *T*-1 's a little frightening E_S ###and in fact , well , I , N_S ###within our family we have said , N_S 
85129:6	###I mean , \[ you , \+ you \] read about \[ the , \+ the \] \[ fairly , \+ fairly \] stiff laws 0 they put *T*-1 in on cars now 0 \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] enforcing *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###The smog and , N_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###SpeakerA99 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###But , uh , again , uh , that did n't occur without a crisis . E_S 
85413:11	###SpeakerA88 . ###Anywhere near , uh , Virginia Beach ? E_S ###SpeakerB89 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ My , \+ uh , my \] folks used *-1 to live there . E_S ###Back before I was born *-1 , they lived there . E_S ###SpeakerA90 . ###Oh . E_S 
85436:14	###so I imagine 0 \[ the , \+ the \] type of houses and , uh , things like that are truly different from area to area . E_S ###SpeakerA96 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , N_S ###SpeakerB97 . ###But , uh , that 's the same way out here E_S ###because , um , well , \[ we , \+ for example , \[ and \+ \] we \] live fifteen miles from the beltway that *T*-1 surrounds Washington E_S ###SpeakerA98 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB99 . 
85473:23	###Land has gotten so expensive E_S ###they just ca n't afford *-1 to have low income housing like that . E_S ###SpeakerA110 . ###So , is your house in an area by itself ? E_S ###I mean , N_S ###SpeakerB111 . ###No , E_S ###we 're in a development . E_S ###SpeakerA112 . ###it 's not connected to another one ? E_S 
85568:164	###and I mean they think differently E_S ###and their idea of what *T*-1 is justice is totally different from ours . E_S ###\[ And , \+ and \] right now , \[ I , \+ I \] think that that 's been proven *-1 in the fact that , um , they have just , N_S ###well , anyway , I just think that , you know , the United States policy over there , N_S ###I think 0 we should just leave them alone .

85582:30	###\[ I mean , tha- , \+ I mean , I 'm \] talking about the whole middle ea- , E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] maybe this is too general , E_S ###but I just believe that , um , they do not look at democracy the same way 0 we do *T*-1 .

85619:6	###and I do n't think 0 we 'd be talking about this , you know , the \[ Israeli situation , \+ Palestinian situation , \] um , sort of came to a head , um , unless there had been a war .

85690:8	###, I mean , every thought , E_S ###they have a totally different life than we have *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###And they have very basic life , um , E_S 
85706:32	###\[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ you know , and , \] \[ it , \+ it 's \] almost like , N_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###What *T*-1 's sad is that the leaders that *T*-2 have control are power , E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well that 's , see using that , E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###SpeakerA69 . ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . 
85776:112	###I think that , uh , too many , uh , N_S ###the problem \[ \[ with , \+ with \] \+ \] right now is \[ w- , \+ \] that we 've got too many different health insurances that people have *-1 to go through *T*-2 E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] \[ I think that , \+ I think \] 0 \[ you , \+ you \] mentioned Canada .

E_S ###SpeakerA7 . 
85788:198	###SpeakerB8 . ###SpeakerA9 . ###SpeakerB10 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###SpeakerB12 . ###Right .

85805:33	###but for dependent coverage I 'm paying a hundred and seventy dollars \[ a , \+ a \] month or something like that . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Right .

E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###SpeakerA19 . ###They 're probably picking up about half of it . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Right . E_S 
85823:26	###SpeakerB26 . ###Yeah , E_S ###H M O . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###SpeakerB28 . ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] fairly expensive .

E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###\[ they , \+ they \] charge five dollars E_S a \[ s- , \+ \] you know , pop , E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Yeah .

86032:14	###and we were living in France at the time E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh-huh .

86592:54	###SpeakerB78 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###SpeakerB80 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###It 's not * to keep people *ICH*-3 from *-1 buying a gun that *T*-2 need one for a specific purpose , legal purpose but * to keep the guy that *T*-4 's illegal from *-5 getting his hands on one .

86927:31	###And I disagree , E_S ###and I think 0 that 's really contributing to this high rate of crime . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Yes , E_S ###yes .

87709:65	###SpeakerA47 . ###Absolutely . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Whereas \[ \[ in , \+ in , \] \+ uh , in \] Dallas here \[ \[ we 've , \+ we 've got , \] \+ \] uh , those patterns were well established \[ before , \+ before \] we really \[ tried * to , \+ tried *-1 to \] do the DART .

87715:219	###SpeakerA49 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Yeah , E_S ###* just take like in Chicago where the people depend on the public transportation system * to get them everywhere *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . 
87852:11	###SpeakerB26 . ###So , that was kind of interesting . E_S ###I 've , N_S ###but I really enjoyed it . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###So , I w- , N_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Because \[ that , \+ that \] just reminds me of , you know , like back in school E_S and , you know , the girlfriends just taking off for a day or something . Just getting in trouble and probably not that much trouble E_S 
87902:52	###huh ? E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Righ- , E_S ###well , I think 0 she kept *-1 saying that , uh , E_S ###they talked about her , E_S ###\[ it , \+ it \] was a film of her concert , um , tour 0 she had taken *T*-1 through \[ all , \+ all \] around the world . E_S ###And they were all MUMBLEx to her at the Vatican city and would n't let her perform in Rome , E_S ###and she , kept *-1 saying that her show was not garbage . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Huh . E_S 
87929:27	###SpeakerB54 . ###She is *?* . E_S ###She 's rich . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and she 's rich E_S ###and she , N_S ###yeah , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerB56 . 
88195:6	###It 's like very peculiar circumstances and very peculiar things that people do *T*-1 with each other E_S ###SpeakerB156 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA157 . ###\[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] you know , N_S ###and it 's just sort of a , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay . E_S ###Uh , do you own a P C by the way ? E_S ###I 'm guessing 0 you probably do . E_S 
88366:4	###It may be improved by now E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###That 's what I 've heard *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ it 's , \+ uh , Wordstar was \] never very intuitive to me . E_S ###I mean you know , you , N_S ###some of the commands just had nothing 0 * to do *T*-4 with , you know , \[ what you were supposed *-2 to be doing *T*-3 \+ \[ what they , \+ what they \] did *T*-1 on the \[ com- , \+ computer \] \] E_S ###but , uh , N_S 
88392:20	###\[ And you , \+ and it \] does a lot of things too that \[ if you , \+ if you \] do any kind of , uh , research or anything like that where you have *-1 to , uh , use footnotes *T*-2 , it is just wonderful . Because it keeps track of all your footnotes . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###SpeakerB76 . ###Oh , that 's neat . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and \[ if you add it , \+ if you put a footnote \] \[ in , \+ in \] the middle , you know , if you come up with some new piece of documentation and you put that in the middle of your paper and have *-1 to footnote it , \[ you just change , \+ um , it just automatically changes \] all your footnoting numbers for you . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . 
88561:15	###and I think about all the people that he talks to *T*-1 all over the , N_S ###SpeakerB1 . ###Do you have children ? E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###Uh , yes , E_S ###yes , E_S ###I have a daughter . E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Do you . E_S ###SpeakerA4 . 
88831:6	###So , uh , \[ It 's , \+ it MUMBLEx \] , N_S ###SpeakerB119 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA120 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] was involved in some , uh , oh , alumnae recruiting , uh , here in town , uh , recently , uh , well last year . E_S ###SpeakerB121 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA122 . ###Uh , and it was kind of fun , because you are \[ trying * \[ to \+ to , \] \+ trying *-1 to \] get people interested in your school , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB123 . 
88922:25	###SpeakerA1 . ###What was one of the latest ones that you 've seen *T*-1 , actually *T*-2 ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Oh , \[ I gue- , \+ I think \] 0 we rented PRETTY WOMAN a couple \[ weeks , \+ months \] ago . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###SpeakerA5 . ###Right . E_S ###The last two years , I have done more theater movie going than I have actually watched videos at home . E_S 
88982:43	###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh , I think 0 I know who you are talking about *T*-1 though . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Yeah . E_S ###At any rate , I also saw not long ago ONCE AROUND . E_S ###That was with Richard Dreyfuss . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###And , that one was just a very poignant story , E_S 
89066:8	###SpeakerB56 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###And that 's the way 0 I do it *T*-1 E_S ###and I go quite frequently . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###If you are going *-1 to be planning on * doing that , N_S ###now I was WARLOCK *ICH*-5 too , which *T*-1 is supposed *-2 to be the story of a , uh , witch hunt that *T*-3 is , you know , magically shot *-4 into the present time . E_S 
89085:14	###But , uh , the action was comfortable E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###and , of course , I enjoyed those good guy , bad guy type conflicts things . E_S ###So , I enjoyed that movie , after the first few minutes of gore . E_S ###And there were some others , E_S ###but they were done *-1 a little more tastefully . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Yeah . E_S 
89160:8	###SpeakerB90 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###And , \[ after , \+ after \] that I get involved *-1 in other things and \[ do n't want * to \+ do n't want *-1 to \] go back . E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###SpeakerB94 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I 've heard 0 that 's , N_S 
89229:16	###SpeakerB110 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###And \[ he , \+ he \] has that merry look about his eyes that *T*-1 looks like he stays in mischief all time . E_S ###And , I enjoy those , E_S ###and I enjoy some of the Michael J . Fox movies . E_S ###I did n't care too much for the last one either . E_S ###It just was not enough to it . E_S ###SpeakerB112 . ###What was the last one *T*-1 ? E_S 
89269:6	###SpeakerA4 . ###Yeah , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###so that implies ownership . E_S ###SpeakerA6 . ###No one else has offered *-1 to pay for it . E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###That 's right . E_S ###I would not object if anybody did . E_S 
89345:48	###Do you understand ? E_S ###How does that sound *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###There you go *T*-1 . E_S ###* Write that one down . E_S ###SpeakerB29 . ###Yeah , E_S ###there I go *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###It sounded good to me . E_S 
89426:83	###so , I think 0 the high end is definitely , you know somewhere there . E_S ###SpeakerB61 . ###Well , * try and think if it was a hundred dollars a square foot . E_S ###No , E_S ###it could not be *?* , E_S ###because this house has around thirty four hundred square feet , E_S ###and it would never sell for three hundred forty thousand dollars . E_S ###SpeakerA62 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB63 . 
89427:22	###SpeakerB61 . ###Well , * try and think if it was a hundred dollars a square foot . E_S ###No , E_S ###it could not be *?* , E_S ###because this house has around thirty four hundred square feet , E_S ###and it would never sell for three hundred forty thousand dollars . E_S ###SpeakerA62 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB63 . ###Just never . E_S 
89432:9	###and it would never sell for three hundred forty thousand dollars . E_S ###SpeakerA62 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB63 . ###Just never . E_S ###SpeakerA64 . ###Well . E_S ###SpeakerB65 . ###Now , maybe , you know , that 's pretty close to what it would have sold for *T*-1 , uh , * brand new , E_S ###or that 's pretty much what it was built *-1 for *T*-2 . E_S 
89515:37	###SpeakerA88 . ###I 'm really excited about it , E_S ###SpeakerB89 . ###SpeakerA90 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB91 . ###and , uh , the house is built *-1 around the trees . E_S ###SpeakerA92 . ###Great . E_S ###SpeakerB93 . 
89566:50	###SpeakerA110 . ###He has no insulation , probably . E_S ###SpeakerB111 . ###it 's because \[ there 's not a \+ there 's no \] \[ insulation , \+ insulation \] in those things . E_S ###SpeakerA112 . ###Oh , my . E_S ###SpeakerB113 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA114 . ###Gosh . E_S 
89601:9	###SpeakerA2 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###And I do n't have elderly parents , yet ###but not that far in the distant future . E_S ###What about yourself ? E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###Well , my parents are both in their seventies . E_S ###\[ My , \+ my \] mother and stepfather , and my father and stepmother are all in their seventies . E_S ###And , my , uh , uh , father and stepmother are not in very good health . E_S 
89785:10	###SpeakerA68 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB69 . ###Like this was a really neat vital woman E_S ###and you get in a nursing home E_S ###and the first thing that *T*-1 happens you have *-2 to share \[ your , \+ your \] whole living space , with someone that you have never known *T*-3 before in your life . E_S ###SpeakerA70 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB71 . 
89799:42	###but I do know that there are some wonderful places out there E_S ###and \[ it , \+ I think 0 it \] does , N_S ###a lot of it goes down to just money . And family support , E_S ###SpeakerA74 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB75 . ###uh , if you , you know , have family that , uh , you can live with *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA76 . ###Visits everyday . E_S ###SpeakerB77 . 
90016:15	###and \[ she had , \+ before it actually got big , she sent \] me this book *-1 saying , you might like this , E_S ###this guy is , you know , from here . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Uh . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###And , uh , I read it and really liked it E_S ###and then about , N_S ###that is when it really got big *T*-1 . E_S ###And , uh , so I , N_S ###SpeakerA61 . 
90018:6	###SpeakerA59 . ###Uh . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###And , uh , I read it and really liked it E_S ###and then about , N_S ###that is when it really got big *T*-1 . E_S ###And , uh , so I , N_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###That was good , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . 
90059:19	###SpeakerB74 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###SpeakerB76 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###\[ and , \+ and so , \] \[ it was , \+ it was \] a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast *T*-1 off in the movie . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . 
90114:6	###SpeakerA2 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###and , uh , I thank God every day that I have the resources that we have tapped into *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###Now , is he the elementary school ? E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###He 's in elementary school . E_S ###SpeakerA6 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
90205:30	###Something is wrong here . E_S ###SpeakerA36 . ###You 're \[ right , \+ right . \] E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###And the teacher kept *-1 saying , oh , he has a May birthday . E_S ###He 's just immature . E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB39 . ###Well , second grade it was *T*-1 , N_S 
90206:4	###SpeakerA36 . ###You 're \[ right , \+ right . \] E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###And the teacher kept *-1 saying , oh , he has a May birthday . E_S ###He 's just immature . E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB39 . ###Well , second grade it was *T*-1 , N_S ###I will , N_S 
90228:25	###and thank God \[ the li- , \+ the head \] teacher , the team leader , was a special education major . E_S ###SpeakerA44 . ###Oh , how great . E_S ###SpeakerB45 . ###\[ It was , \+ it was *?* \] E_S ###and , She had picked it up , E_S ###SpeakerA46 . ###So \[ she , \+ she \] was able *-1 to zero in . E_S ###SpeakerB47 . ###yep , E_S 
90245:69	###SpeakerA50 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB51 . ###and she said , I think 0 we can get him real fast . E_S ###SpeakerA52 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB53 . ###And sure enough , they tested him E_S ###and , you know , he qualified \[ for , \+ for \] the help , E_S 
90327:8	###and * proceed *-1 to prove it . E_S ###SpeakerB87 . ###Really , E_S ###really . E_S ###SpeakerA88 . ###So \[ I , \+ I \] really hate that for them . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I , \] would rather 0 they not have that attitude , E_S ###SpeakerB89 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA90 . 
90388:74	###SpeakerB111 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA112 . ###and if they do n't , \[ then af- , \+ \] when they reach a certain age *T*-1 , \[ they just , \+ \] that 's the end of their schooling . E_S ###SpeakerB113 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA114 . ###\[ And , \+ and , \] uh , they do n't ever really go on . E_S ###It 's only their top ones that *T*-1 go on , like ours do . E_S ###SpeakerB115 . 
90407:8	###SpeakerB119 . ###Right , E_S ###SpeakerA120 . ###SpeakerB121 . ###well , you see that with the foreigners that *T*-1 come here . E_S ###SpeakerA122 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB123 . ###Um , \[ I , \+ I \] was talking to somebody recently or read somewhere \[ where they , \+ where they \] said that , you know , these children , \[ they , \+ they \] had *-2 to be the best *T*-1 , E_S ###and they put off all social life , all everything , you know . E_S 
90407:29	###SpeakerB119 . ###Right , E_S ###SpeakerA120 . ###SpeakerB121 . ###well , you see that with the foreigners that *T*-1 come here . E_S ###SpeakerA122 . ###That 's right .

E_S 
90424:6	###but on the other hand , I feel like my children , who *T*-1 are kind of middle of the road , \[ have , \+ are \] more rounded , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA126 . ###Better coping skills . E_S ###SpeakerB127 . ###SpeakerA128 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB129 . ###Sure , E_S ###sure , E_S ###I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's real important * to have friends . E_S 
90440:34	###We did n't do all that you know . E_S ###SpeakerA132 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB133 . ###We certainly did n't carpool and run the way 0 I do *T*-1 . ###Um , E_S ###SpeakerA134 . ###Well , and \[ you do n't , \+ you do n't \] see the parents , uh , encouraging those students to get on athletic teams or , drill teams or band , E_S ###SpeakerB135 . ###No . E_S 
90574:8	###originally when we had them *T*-1 , uh , they were mainly my mother 's , E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###Relatives , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerB39 . ###uh , father 's . E_S ###My mother 's father 's family had quite a few , uh , brothers and sisters . E_S ###SpeakerA40 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB41 . 
90651:47	###SpeakerA64 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB65 . ###It 's more of \[ a , \+ you know , a \] \[ smaller , \+ smaller \] unit , E_S ###and you know , \[ we , \+ we \] tend *-1 to try *-2 to do things , I think 0 *T*-5 with our immediate family , as opposed to the extended family .

90762:8	###so , we are glad that we took that opportunity two years ago . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Well , Steve , did you go to college ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Yeah . E_S ###In fact , I 'm still going . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Oh , that 's good . E_S ###So you probably could give some great advice . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . 
90794:15	###SpeakerB14 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###And I think 0 that 's one reason why I 'm part of this study *T*-1 , uh , because \[ it 's of , \+ \] I 'm working with voice systems . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ So , \+ so , \] good luck . E_S ###I guess 0 we should talk about * giving advice , though . E_S 
90811:21	###and the kid at that age , especially if they 're going into undergraduate , it seems like they think 0 they know what they want *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###\[ An , \+ and , \] I mean , * choosing from my experience , you know , I thought , you know , 0 \[ my , \+ I know what I want *T*-2 a lot more than my \] parents know what I want *T*-1 .

90856:55	###and I always say * make * sure 0 you major , in something that you like *T*-1 , even if it 's not going *-2 to be your career vocation , because you 'll get better grades . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###SpeakerA37 . ###SpeakerB38 . ###SpeakerA39 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 most employers would probably rather *ICH*-1 hire , you know , \[ a , \+ a \] three six \[ in , \+ um , in \] history , uh , * to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Does that make sense ? E_S 
90914:54	###\[ they 're not , \+ th- , \] N_S ###\[ it , \+ it 's \] the minimal cost . E_S ###But I think 0 you can get a good education at public or private E_S ###but I think 0 you can also get a bad education at public or private , you know , E_S ###I N_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###\[ you have *-1 to really , \+ you have *-2 to \] look around at the school .

90924:33	###SpeakerB60 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###I think , uh , 0 I would agree with that . E_S ###In fact , \[ the thing that , \+ I 'm going through the same thing , \] where in graduate school , I was trying *-1 to choose . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Uh-huh .

91029:97	###and , uh , um , where was I at *T*-1 ? E_S ###Oh , \[ go- , \+ in * going \] to school , you get taught *-1 the things 0 you learn *T*-2 in school , E_S ###but there is also a whole other dimension , I mean the growing up while you 're going *-1 to school *T*-2 part . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###And , uh , actually , in the Midwest especially , a lot of the schools \[ have , \+ like University of Missouri , will have \] a main campus like Columbia , which *T*-1 is big , multi disciplinary , E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###Right . E_S 
91352:8	###but , um , N_S ###SpeakerB114 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###I 'm doing some reviews of books , *-2 \[ just to , \+ \] \[ what , \+ \] to sort of recommend \[ to \+ \] \[ wh- , \+ whether \] or not a full-scale review should be done *-1 for the journal , E_S ###SpeakerB116 . ###Oh , how neat .

91368:18	###SpeakerB120 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###SpeakerB122 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA123 . ###This one is on Johann Sebastian Bach , E_S ###and it 's \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ a \] biography , that *T*-1 is really interesting , E_S ###SpeakerB124 . ###Oh , great . E_S 
91398:29	###so it 's a brand new book . E_S ###SpeakerB134 . ###Oh , it 's a brand new book . E_S ###SpeakerA135 . ###Yeah , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB136 . ###Oh , \[ that , \+ that \] would be wonderful * to read something like that . E_S ###SpeakerA137 . ###Yeah , E_S 
91586:33	###SpeakerB9 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA10 . ###So they 're pretty much just reunited always E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###so \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] just once in a while 0 we get the special gathering with everyone together *T*-1 .

91617:24	###SpeakerA24 . ###Oh , that 's good . E_S ###SpeakerB25 . ###And all of the descendants of \[ the Civil War , \+ I mean , \[ yeah , \+ \] the Civil War \] veterans come together , E_S ###and they come as far away from California , E_S ###and there 's usually oh , between a hundred and fifty and two hundred and fifty people . E_S ###SpeakerA26 . ###And then where do you meet *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###Uh , there 's a big community hall in Vernon Texas , E_S 
91642:17	###SpeakerA34 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB35 . ###Um , all of his direct \[ descendants , \+ descendants \] have now died E_S ###and the grandchildren are in their seventies and eighties . E_S ###SpeakerA36 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###So we 're talking about second and third great children here . E_S ###SpeakerA38 .

91713:69	###SpeakerB65 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA66 . ###Well , that 's good .

93288:10	###so , N_S ###SpeakerB101 . ###Is n't that the truth , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA102 . ###Huh . Well , that sounds wonderful .

93541:28	###SpeakerA57 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###I do that at the end of the day , E_S ###and it takes , you know , N_S ###\[ \[ that , \+ that \] \+ during that \] time the stress from the day goes away .

93547:51	###I get *-1 to share whatever I did *T*-2 with my wife , \[ and , \+ and \] vice versa . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Right .

E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Uh-huh E_S ###SpeakerB62 . 
93573:48	###SpeakerA69 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###and that 's no fun . E_S ###And it *EXP*-1 's so hard *ICH*-2 * to get past that for a lot of people . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Right , E_S ###that 's , N_S ###I never got past that stage . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . 
93585:42	###I think 0 I look better . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###\[ \[ I have just a , \+ I do n't , \] \+ I 'm not a \] huge person , E_S ###I 'm just a regular looking guy , E_S ###but just * going *-1 to lift weights on occasion with my wife , E_S ###and my wife thinks the same thing *ICH*-1 about both me and herself that * get that little bit of definition in your muscles \[ is , \+ is \] attractive E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
93593:8	###SpeakerA75 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###SpeakerA77 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###so that pays also . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###That 's good . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . 
93692:11	###SpeakerA119 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB120 . ###and what *T*-1 's real funny about plans is that there 's a struggle \[ between , \+ \] uh , \[ \[ when you , \+ when you add something to your life *T*-2 , \] \+ when you add a plan to your life *T*-3 , \] E_S ###something else has *-1 to go away E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###Well , the answer 's sleep , right . E_S 
93852:6	###Have you ever had , that ? E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###I do n't know , E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###SpeakerA41 . ###what that is *T*-1 . E_S ###No E_S ###I do n't know what that is *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###You take a flour tortilla E_S 
93991:34	###and I , N_S ###everybody seems *-1 to like it . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###Do you want scrambled ? E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###So . Sometimes it seems *-1 to be cheaper , too , E_S ###so we often buy it E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . 
93993:4	###SpeakerB88 . ###Do you want scrambled ? E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###So . Sometimes it seems *-1 to be cheaper , too , E_S ###so we often buy it E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###SpeakerB92 . ###Yeah E_S 
94013:30	###SpeakerB96 . ###SpeakerA97 . ###SpeakerB98 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###Or in , N_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###I do n't think 0 mine know either . E_S ###In fact , we 've been getting lunch meat that *T*-1 's turkey , too . E_S 
94134:51	###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###but now they , uh , have a golf tournament on the Saturday . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###And then they have generally a show or an auction or something *ICH*-4 on Saturday night 0 *T*-3 to help *-1 raise funds 0 *T*-2 to cover the costs of such . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Oh , that 's a neat idea . E_S 
94148:6	###SpeakerB36 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###and then for the Saturday night dinner they bring in like Kentucky Fried Chicken from Durant , E_S ###and uh it really , uh , has worked out . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###SpeakerB40 . ###How many people , Jim , *T*-1 are involved ? E_S 
94239:15	###and I think 0 we 've been to one in thirty-five years or something like that , E_S ###so , That 's just too far away . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###SpeakerB74 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah E_S ###\[ that , \+ that \] is a problem with the distance . E_S ###The people that we have *T*-2 that *T*-1 do n't come are out El Paso way E_S 
94358:12	###SpeakerA127 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well we 've , uh , had various things *ICH*-2 over the years , uh , 0 *T*-1 to raise funds for it E_S ###SpeakerB128 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA129 . ###and again , \[ it 's not , \+ it *EXP*-1 's not \] cheap * to rent the lodge up there or the meeting room down in the cabins and such , E_S ###SpeakerB130 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA131 . 
94401:34	###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###but it 's , N_S ###I do n't know , E_S ###to me it seems like the schools are reflecting society in a bigger way you know , because , I mean , the general values that we 're teaching *T*-1 kind of conflict with what we expect *T*-2 out of people in school , I mean , E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###SpeakerA7 . 
94431:63	###You know , if , N_S ###I think 0 too many parents expect , uh , the school to teach , uh , the moral aspects \[ of , \+ of \] things \[ to the st- , \+ to the kids \] \[ and , \+ \] you know , while we 're not going *-1 to worry about , uh , *-2 teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that , you know , and then expect them to pick it up at school , E_S ###you 're not going *-1 to do that , you know , E_S ###you 're going *-2 to \[ \[ carry , \+ carry with , \] \+ carry to \] school , uh , out into the world , you know , what you learned *T*-1 at home , E_S ###and , uh uh , I think that that part of that showing up now , you know , \[ with , \+ with \] things because kids I think have probably less respect \[ than \+ \] \[ for , \+ for \] people \[ than \+ \] \[ in , \+ in \] other things , than we may have seen in the past , uh , E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###and part of it 's \[ the , \+ the \] family , I think 0 *T*-1 , E_S ###and part of it 's , uh , the living conditions \[ of \+ \] 0 certain people are subjected *-1 too *T*-2 , E_S 
94449:21	###but I wonder , you know , E_S ###do you get the , N_S ###oh , that 's kind of side tracked , E_S ###but , uh , I just remember *-1 seeing on the news the other night , 0 they had the thing about how Catholic schools are doing so much better *T*-2 E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###I thought , well , you know , of course they 're doing better , ###and not so much when I was growing up *T*-1 , E_S Catholic schools are generally considered *-1 a little bit easier than the public schools , E_S ###but , uh , they still had \[ a , \+ a \] better success rate , simply because they started with a lot better raw material . E_S 
94583:38	###SpeakerA19 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Uh , when my children were growing up *T*-1 , \[ I actually had them , \+ up and until they were in the preschool situation , I had them \] \[ in a , \+ in a \] home with a lady who *T*-2 kept two or three kids , E_S ###and I felt like that home environment was very important to them .

94583:77	###SpeakerA19 . ###Uh-huh .

94669:119	###SpeakerA61 . ###Yes , E_S ###it is *?* .

95045:11	###but we have a modem . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###At home you have a modem that you can connect *T*-1 to each of them ? E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Neither one , N_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###SpeakerA43 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Uh , and so it 's an external modem . E_S

97256:22	###SpeakerB60 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###And , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Our oldest grandson , when he was eighteen months old *T*-1 went into \[ a , \+ a \] Montessori , day care system . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###And they took infants starting at six weeks , E_S 
97269:35	###they \[ keep , \+ deliberately keep \] the room not real bright . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Uh-huh .

97387:11	###SpeakerB112 . ###Uh . E_S ###SpeakerA113 . ###SpeakerB114 . ###Uh . E_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###Incredible , E_S ###but you know , since this is , N_S ###people before they get pregnant are finding child care for the kids . E_S ###SpeakerB116 . 
97460:131	###SpeakerA145 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB146 . ###\[ or , \+ and \] * have some kind of program set *-1 up , like you say , * to stimulate the kids , or educate them in some manner .

E_S ###SpeakerB148 . ###that 's real important to little kids . E_S ###SpeakerA149 . ###Yeah , E_S 
97472:6	###and it 's probably my fault , because I do not have a real schedule now . E_S ###SpeakerB150 . ###Uh-huh .

97493:4	###and it 's , N_S ###I have another friend whose brother and his wife *T*-1 have done this , E_S ###they stay up until all hours of the night . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###All right . E_S ###Well , I am , uh , the product of , uh , I think 0 *T*-2 as much *ICH*-1 the changing roles of women as anyone , E_S ###my mother , uh , N_S ###we come from a , N_S 
97633:57	###SpeakerB56 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###SpeakerB58 . ###Oh , always . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###And , uh , I think 0 things are changing , E_S ###but the changing is taking a long time longer than we would \[ like it to , \+ like it to \] take . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
97653:19	###SpeakerB66 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###And , uh , I think that , uh , in the long term that women are going *-1 to be able *-3 to have the recognition that they deserve *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###And , uh , men , uh , \[ have , \+ a lot of them have , \] uh , come around and have seen , the error of their ways . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
97754:45	###Uh , \[ dictator , \+ dictatorships \] are real efficient . E_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###Well , I guess 0 we would have *-1 to go back to the way that the Lord made us *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB112 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA113 . ###And , uh , the women when they are married *-1 *T*-2 , they are *-3 to be subjective to their husbands . E_S ###SpeakerB114 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA115 . 
97769:83	###SpeakerB118 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA119 . ###And I think 0 the issue should be settled *-1 before there 's a conflict . E_S ###SpeakerB120 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###Uh , and I think 0 that can happen in a very \[ won- , \+ wonderful \] way . E_S ###SpeakerB122 . ###Huh . E_S 
97983:10	###SpeakerB64 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###But \[ the , \+ the \] nine year old will watch anything that *T*-1 's on T V . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Uh-oh , uh-oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###So , N_S ###SpeakerB68 . 
98194:8	###I live here because it 's close to the university . E_S ###SpeakerA10 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###But , you know , we have , uh , N_S ###\[ it , \+ it 's \] really funny , E_S ###the only crime 0 we really see *T*-1 is , uh , just the kids being malicious . E_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB13 . 
98222:24	###so I think 0 our , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###not that we do n't have a certain amount of local problems E_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###Uh-huh E_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###but on the other hand , uh , we get the , uh , affect of \[ the , \+ uh , the \] city E_S ###and , uh , the main crimes within the suburb here are \[ the , \+ the \] theft crimes . A small number of assaults , E_S 
98259:11	###it 's one of those things where , if you 're a grad student you can appreciate the statistics on N_S ###SpeakerB35 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA36 . ###Unfortunately there are often these correlations that *T*-1 are inverse of what they should be *T*-2 like , uh , wherever there are more , uh , criminals *T*-3 , there are more policemen E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###but that 's which *T*-1 came first . E_S ###SpeakerB39 . 
98273:57	###SpeakerB41 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA42 . ###and , well , uh , since now I 'm in my mid-forties , when I was in grad school *T*-1 or when I was an undergraduate *T*-2 * growing up in a more rural area I thought 0 , you know , crime \[ was , \+ was \] reasonably unknown and just the situation that *T*-3 's developed *-4 with \[ the , \+ the \] drug aspect of , uh uh , the pushers , the dealers and the addicts , uh , E_S ###SpeakerB43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA44 . ###SpeakerB45 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA46 . 
98305:40	###SpeakerA56 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB57 . ###SpeakerA58 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB59 . ###That make sense ? E_S ###He 's one of the big proponents of that . E_S ###He gets on national television \[ and , \+ and \] says that , you know . E_S ###So it 's , uh , N_S 
98335:13	###and I think 0 if I look back fifty or a hundred years I 'd say 0 , you know , back then there were the opium dens E_S ###SpeakerB67 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA68 . ###but the thing is , 0 if somebody ruined their life , uh , society did n't try *-1 to then save themselves from it , E_S ###they let this person who *T*-1 had ruined it uh , \[ become , \+ well , die \] or whatever . E_S ###SpeakerB69 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA70 . ###I mean they probably became weakened physically *ICH*-1 and other things to the point that their life expectancy was real short *T*-2 , E_S 
98340:8	###they let this person who *T*-1 had ruined it uh , \[ become , \+ well , die \] or whatever . E_S ###SpeakerB69 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA70 . ###I mean they probably became weakened physically *ICH*-1 and other things to the point that their life expectancy was real short *T*-2 , E_S ###SpeakerB71 . ###Right , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA72 . ###but now we tend *-1 to believe 0 somewhere in the health care system otherwise , E_S we need *-2 to take care of people even if they have , you know , physically ruined themselves . E_S 
98381:4	###\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know , you know , E_S ###the drug culture , N_S ###\[ the , \+ uh , the , \] uh , you know , N_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] see it with the kids in the neighborhood just stealing things , not thinking anything wrong with it . E_S ###SpeakerA86 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , \[ th- , \+ some of that , \] N_S ###and , of course , I 'm a baby of the old school E_S ###SpeakerB87 . ###Yeah . E_S 
98424:45	###in Europe , they seem *-1 to have mentality , E_S ###and drunk driving is a good one , E_S ###* is that people are well indoctrinated *-1 in their society that drunken driving is unacceptable .

98426:8	###* is that people are well indoctrinated *-1 in their society that drunken driving is unacceptable . E_S ###SpeakerB101 . ###Right .

98427:43	###SpeakerB101 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA102 . ###And , yeah , E_S ###if you 're going *-1 to drink , and you may drink , you better have your designated driver .

98436:165	###And we mean it . E_S ###SpeakerB105 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA106 . ###SpeakerB107 . ###Yeah .

98505:12	###we just voted in , uh , \[ gun control , \+ strong gun control \] here in the state of Maryland . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] think , N_S ###SpeakerB1 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###Okay . E_S ###Well , \[ I , \+ uh , I \] guess because I work quite a bit with lawyers , I 'm not a lawyer , uh , that *T*-1 I find 0 a lot of things are so specialized that I 'm not sure , E_S ###and \[ I , \+ I \] look at it more from the civil side of things that juries have any sense \[ of , \+ of \] the value of , and worth , so that they have real problems when it comes to , uh , uh *T*-1 , N_S ###they can find guilt or innocence E_S ###SpeakerB3 . 
98534:38	###SpeakerB9 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA10 . ###Uh , that , uh , N_S ###when I only do something one , two or three times *T*-1 I 'm hardly an expert on it , E_S ###and most juries over a period of five or ten years you might sit on three .

98591:36	###and we do n't have , \[ a- , \+ again , \] a lot of knowledge , E_S ###so we do n't know what *T*-1 is really going on , what *T*-2 is , uh , really the range of sentences or awards that *T*-3 \[ are , \+ uh , are \] actually , uh , in the end applied *-4 . E_S ###SpeakerB31 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA32 . ###SpeakerB33 . ###Right . E_S ###\[ Well , \+ well , \] also what I do n't think 0 *T*-1 is fair , either , is when you have \[ like a , \+ say a \] rapist , come in *T*-2 , E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] his attorney gets his \[ sentences , \+ sentencing \] reduced *-1 because he 's gone to a lesser charge , like , I do n't know what , assault or something or , N_S ###SpeakerA34 . 
98600:22	###SpeakerA34 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB35 . ###But , which \[ that \+ \] does n't make any sense to me either .

98654:6	###the whole truth and nothing but the truth , is that they want , uh , E_S ###they do n't want , uh , the whole truth . E_S ###I mean you can say , E_S ###SpeakerB53 . ###They only put part of it . E_S ###SpeakerA54 . ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB55 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA56 .

99065:65	###And , uh , one thing that I did *T*-1 this summer , which I thought 0 *T*-2 might benefit both my daughters is , 0 my youngest daughter got involved *-3 in band , E_S ###and Baylor has a band camp . E_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB31 . ###So she went for a week , N_S ###and it was overnight , E_S ###and they lived in the dorms . E_S ###And I thought 0 this would expose both of them to what it 's , you know , like *T*-1 on a \[ coll- , \+ a smaller college \] campus . E_S ###And , uh , my oldest one just was n't impressed *ICH*-1 at all with the idea of a small school . E_S 
99067:6	###SpeakerA30 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB31 . ###So she went for a week , N_S ###and it was overnight , E_S ###and they lived in the dorms . E_S ###And I thought 0 this would expose both of them to what it 's , you know , like *T*-1 on a \[ coll- , \+ a smaller college \] campus . E_S ###And , uh , my oldest one just was n't impressed *ICH*-1 at all with the idea of a small school . E_S ###So , uh , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] still think 0 the exposure was good . E_S ###SpeakerA32 . 
99164:22	###And even though Baylor , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB63 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA64 . ###and when you mentioned that *T*-1 , \[ we , \+ we \] have friends who *T*-2 have children *ICH*-4 there who *T*-3 just love it .

99249:6	###SpeakerB10 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###well , \[ I think 0 it 's , \+ I think 0 it 's \] toward Ann Arbor , E_S ###so it 's probably out in that direction , E_S ###but that 's the only one 0 I probably could name *T*-1 after all these years E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###\[ so , \+ But , \] uh , N_S 
99543:6	###so , uh , we get the sled out E_S ###and , uh , the kids go down \[ the hi- , \+ the hill \] on the sleds when it 's icy *T*-1 , E_S ###I mean they just go down the ice . E_S ###SpeakerB108 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###And if it 's cold , we say , okay , out you go . E_S ###SpeakerB110 . ###SpeakerA111 . ###I think 0 we must be the only people on the block that *T*-1 make use of that cold weather and get out there . E_S 
99558:19	###but if you get on the , the , uh , grassy kind of part , you get a little bit of traction , you know , not slip and fall . E_S ###I mean , first , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Hi , E_S ###good morning . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Good morning . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Do you have recycling in Sachse ? E_S ###SpeakerB4 . 
99958:15	###They live down in College Station where , his parents do too *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###SpeakerB4 . ###And they put her in a home last year . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###She appeared *-1 to have a couple of light strokes and started *-1 to , uh , not be able *-2 to be in her apartment on her own . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
100012:46	###I work with a lot of elderly people , E_S ###I 'm a trust officer E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###and so often they think 0 they 're adequately caring for themselves when they 're really not eating \[ very much \+ or very balanced \] meals *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Well , she was almost ridiculous . E_S ###Like she 'd eat ice cream and cookies . E_S ###She 'd , N_S 
100131:35	###and oh , I wish 0 everybody could go that direction rather than *-1 just all of a sudden moving out of the home 0 they 've always been in *T*-2 . E_S ###It 's really kind of difficult . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I have a , um , N_S ###my aunt 's mother is , uh , gotten ill recently E_S ###and , uh , she lives in Pennsylvania , E_S ###they live in Alabama . E_S ###And they 're saying , hey , we need you to be closer E_S ###and you have , women like that , E_S 
100137:11	###and , uh , she lives in Pennsylvania , E_S ###they live in Alabama . E_S ###And they 're saying , hey , we need you to be closer E_S ###and you have , women like that , E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###I do n't to men , N_S ###it seems like the women \[ out \+ just out \] live their husbands , but , very reluctantly , E_S ###that whole , I mean N_S 
100301:58	###and , uh , I had opportunities in high school , * to work in some programs , um E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###SpeakerA14 . ###SpeakerB15 . ###Did you ? E_S ###Oh ! . E_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###\[ and , \+ and \] I agree with what you said *T*-1 that \[ it 's , \+ uh , it \] benefits the person doing it so much 0 I do n't think 0 they realize E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###SpeakerA18 . 
100463:38	###and , uh it 's , N_S ###SpeakerB75 . ###That 's probably true . E_S ###That 's probably true . E_S ###SpeakerA76 . ###I know 0 our church youth group , uh , starts with projects * young E_S ###but they have a high school group that *T*-1 works in the Appalachia area every year . E_S ###SpeakerB77 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA78 . 
100582:6	###SpeakerA19 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###I think really is *?* because if the home , does not place a high priority on education N_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###SpeakerB22 . ###SpeakerA23 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###and , uh , \[ the- , \+ the \] main goal is * making money now E_S 
100592:32	###and it may be a survival thing for the family , which you can understand *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###SpeakerA27 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###So , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###But there can still be an attitude of N_S 
100607:40	###SpeakerB32 . ###Your education . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###SpeakerB34 . ###SpeakerA35 . ###Well when they \[ meant , \+ said \] \[ the , \+ the \] topic , you know , of what *T*-1 's wrong with the public schools *T*-2 , \[ my , \+ my \] first \[ im- , \+ impulse \] was 0 it is n't really what *T*-3 's wrong with the \[ public , \+ public \] schools . E_S ###It 's what *T*-1 's wrong with families . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . 
100620:72	###SpeakerA39 . ###And society in general . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###SpeakerA41 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###they do n't know what * to expect *T*-1 at home . E_S ###They do n't feel secure there , E_S ###they do n't know what *T*-1 's going *-2 to happen just out front of their apartment complex . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . 
100664:27	###SpeakerB58 . ###True . E_S ###I think 0 \[ they , \+ there \] has *-1 to be at least a counselor E_S ###and we just recently had a counselor at elementary . E_S ###We did n't even have counselors in elementary . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Really . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###We have always , though , had three at middle schools because we had about a thousand kids E_S ###and they divided them up between three counselors E_S 
100680:43	###SpeakerA63 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###\[ They \+ they \] do that here . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###SpeakerA65 . ###SpeakerB66 . ###SpeakerA67 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###And I think 0 that would give them more security in * going to the counselor . E_S 
100707:29	###SpeakerA77 . ###Yes , E_S ###it certainly is *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###and , uh , if we have children who *T*-1 are not getting their education , for one reason or another , then what are we going *-2 to do *T*-3 with them ? E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Yeah . E_S ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###What *T*-1 's going *-2 to happen to them ? E_S 
100735:61	###Then I think 0 they decided *-1 to strike economic . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###Anyway , you know , the point was , what *T*-1 happens when public education fails *T*-2 ? E_S ###You know will then people go to private schools ? E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###You know , well , what kind of a situation do they get *T*-1 there E_S 
100740:47	###You know will then people go to private schools ? E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###You know , well , what kind of a situation do they get *T*-1 there E_S ###and what are , you know , N_S ###and what kind of state are we in *T*-1 \[ if , \+ if \] most people are going to private schools . E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###Well I think , uh , 0 one thing that we 'll see *T*-1 is that we wo n't be educating everybody . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . 
100929:25	###So there was real continuity . E_S ###SpeakerB41 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA42 . ###She went back as a teenager E_S ###and these people that *T*-1 had changed her diapers when she was three *T*-2 were still there . E_S ###SpeakerB43 . ###Oh , my gosh . E_S ###SpeakerA44 . ###So , \[ it , \+ it \] was really neat . E_S 
101136:8	###I 've , N_S ###of course it 's too late for me ###so \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] not tried them *-2 to see how effective they are *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerB127 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA128 . ###but I think 0 we 're finally beginning *-1 to make progress but just not very fast . E_S ###SpeakerB129 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Uh-huh . E_S 
101164:40	###SpeakerA138 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB139 . ###SpeakerA140 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB141 . ###they have children . E_S ###SpeakerA142 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB143 . 
101164:56	###SpeakerA138 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB139 . ###SpeakerA140 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB141 . ###they have children . E_S ###SpeakerA142 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB143 . 
101218:29	###SpeakerA166 . ###Well in Plano though the problem is 0 , you find , N_S ###and this is what I found *T*-1 with Emily . E_S ###\[ I , \+ from the time 0 she started first grade *T*-1 , I \] wanted her out in Plano area . E_S ###SpeakerB167 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA168 . ###And I kept *-1 finding neighbors and friends E_S ###and they 'd move . E_S ###SpeakerB169 . 
101220:18	###and this is what I found *T*-1 with Emily . E_S ###\[ I , \+ from the time 0 she started first grade *T*-1 , I \] wanted her out in Plano area . E_S ###SpeakerB167 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA168 . ###And I kept *-1 finding neighbors and friends E_S ###and they 'd move . E_S ###SpeakerB169 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA170 . 
101323:21	###and we do it N_S like for special stuff celebrations ###\[ and , \+ \] we have like steak E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###and he does the steak E_S ###and then uh , N_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Out on the grill ? E_S ###SpeakerB42 . 
101432:6	###SpeakerA81 . ###Does he , ooh . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###\[ I 'm not , \+ I do n't \] eat enchiladas . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###\[ \[ I , \+ I do n't like enchila- , \] \+ I do n't like the tex- , \] N_S ###I do n't know , E_S ###I guess 0 it 's the texture , or something . E_S 
101447:18	###SpeakerA87 . ###Well , \[ are , \+ these are \] done *-1 with a flour tortilla . E_S ###Is that what he uses *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###I do n't know , E_S ###\[ I , \+ it 's , \] I do n't know what , E_S 
101684:15	###SpeakerB198 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA199 . ###So , oh , year or so ago he found out E_S ###and he went on a fairly strict diet *-1 to try *-2 to get it down . And did ! E_S ###He was able *-1 to get it down . E_S ###\[ It 's , \+ I think 0 it 's \] mostly hereditary because we really have never eaten high things in cholesterol . E_S ###SpeakerB200 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA201 . 
101714:17	###Well , I think 0 we 've probably talked long enough E_S ###and . N_S ###SpeakerB1 . ###Hello . E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###Hello . E_S ###My name is Nola . E_S ###I 'm in Plano , Texas . E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Hi Nola , E_S 
101721:6	###I 'm in Plano , Texas . E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Hi Nola , E_S ###I 'm Steve . E_S ###I 'm in Dallas , Texas . E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###Not too far away . E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###No , E_S ###that 's unusual . E_S 
101869:125	###SpeakerA62 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB63 . ###SpeakerA64 . ###\[ It 's already , \+ It already \] costs society much more because of it . E_S ###SpeakerB65 . ###SpeakerA66 . ###You know it , N_S ###* trying *-1 to do all these programs like Headstart and things like those . You would n't have *-2 to do that if mothers would stay home with their children and do things with them , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB67 . 
101889:41	###SpeakerB71 . ###Oh rather than she needs the money just she wants the stimulating environment . E_S ###SpeakerA72 . ###Rather than that , she has *-1 to have the money particularly . E_S ###SpeakerB73 . ###SpeakerA74 . ###SpeakerB75 . ###SpeakerA76 . ###Or , maybe there 's a small need for money E_S ###so she does it partly because of the money but partly for herself , too . You know , E_S 
101952:52	###SpeakerB101 . ###When they 're young *T*-1 , N_S ###SpeakerA102 . ###SpeakerB103 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA104 . ###The home is the base , E_S ###it 's the basic unit . E_S ###And that 's \[ the , \+ \] where it all starts *T*-1 E_S ###and if we do n't start *-1 making changes in the homes N_S 
101959:6	###it 's the basic unit . E_S ###And that 's \[ the , \+ \] where it all starts *T*-1 E_S ###and if we do n't start *-1 making changes in the homes N_S ###and maybe part of that is * educating parents better . E_S ###SpeakerB105 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA106 . ###And * educating , uh , you know , N_S ###SpeakerB107 . ###* Changing people 's expectations . E_S 
101971:128	###but , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , E_S ###well I guess 0 I enjoy *-1 eating out , um , uh , here and there , E_S ###or \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] \[ a good change and , \+ a good change from * cooking and \] eating at home E_S ###and I guess 0 I like \[ a variety of , \+ a variety of \] restaurants . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh , sometimes it *EXP*-1 's fun * to go out and just have a hamburger and french fries \[ and , \+ and \] sort of a hamburger and french fry meal , E_S 
102072:44	###\[ I , \+ I \] like different kinds of food . E_S ###So , when we go out *T*-1 , I 'm always looking for something other than the standard menu , even if , it 's a Mexican Restaurant , like something other than , uh , you know the standard tacos , enchiladas , tamales and fajitas now . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . ###You 're brave . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Yes , E_S ###yes E_S ###and once in a while things backfire . E_S 
102134:13	###SpeakerA67 . ###\[ That 's , \+ That 's \] right . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###And you know , when they say , you know , *-1 buy one * get one free *T*-2 . It 's hard 0 * to resist *T*-3 , E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###SpeakerB70 . ###SpeakerA71 . ###SpeakerB72 . ###so we 'll go in . E_S ###And very often we 'll , find a place that we like *T*-1 E_S 
102479:58	###and I was up there half a day and came home and collapsed . E_S ###SpeakerA76 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB77 . ###And then they called me *-1 to see if I wanted *-2 to work a day . E_S ###And I said , yeah , E_S ###and I went E_S ###and of course it took me the whole weekend *-1 to recover from that . E_S ###And , uh , I worked about three days a week *ICH*-1 ever since , two to three days a week . E_S ###And so I went to my doctors last Thursday , E_S 
102643:44	###I do n't know if you , ###have you ever been there ? E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###I 've heard of that E_S ###but I have n't been there . E_S ###Um , where , about is that *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###SpeakerA11 . ###SpeakerB12 . ###Um , well actually there 's the Atlantic Cafe and Cafe Pacific , and , uh , N_S 
102686:8	###SpeakerA27 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Um , and \[ o- , \+ originally \] the two , \[ the , \+ the \] guy who *T*-1 owns the Cafe Pacific and \[ th- , \+ the \] guy who *T*-2 owns the Atlantic Cafe , were partners in the Atlantic Cafe . E_S ###And then \[ they , \+ they \] separated E_S ###and the guy started Cafe Pacific . E_S ###And , I loved them both . E_S ###I really do . E_S ###I think 0 they 're wonderful . E_S ###That 's our favorite . E_S 
102697:81	###Have you been there ? E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###No , um , E_S ###but I 've heard 0 that 's really good , too , E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###It 's wonderful . E_S ###The only thing is 0 you have *-1 to wait . E_S ###\[ You have , \+ you have \] *-1 to expect *-2 to wait at least an hour . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . 
102705:8	###\[ You have , \+ you have \] *-1 to expect *-2 to wait at least an hour . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###So you have *-1 to go *-2 knowing 0 you 're going *-3 to be sitting there there for an hour * waiting *-4 to get in . E_S ###And , \[ a- , \+ as \] long as you know that , it 's okay . E_S ###But they have , I think , \[ one , \+ \] just about the best prime rib um , anywhere in the area . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . 
102766:32	###SpeakerA55 . ###Oh , I 've heard about that , too E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Maxwell 's nice , E_S ###have you been there ? E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###but no . E_S ###\[ We 've , \+ uh , I guess 0 we eat \] out even less than I realize . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###And I did n't think 0 we ate out very often . E_S 
103021:13	###So , we 're very fortunate ###but I know 0 in some areas , \[ \[ \[ it 's really , \+ it , \] \+ it really is \] bad . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###SpeakerA11 . ###Um , I was trying *-1 to think , uh , N_S ###something 0 we were watching *T*-1 the other day N_S ###and they were doing an overview of Los Angeles , uh , from an area that *T*-1 was up higher E_S ###and you literally could see the band of smog . E_S 
103056:21	###SpeakerA23 . ###Yes . E_S ###Well , I know , uh , 0 that 's been the concern in Europe . E_S ###They had n't , N_S ###uh , we have friends in Germany and , uh , have family that *T*-1 live near the Black Forest area E_S ###and large areas of the forest are being hurt *-1 from the cars because when we , \[ s- , \+ uh , switched \] to the unleaded gas \[ and , \+ and \] had the emission control \[ advice , \+ uh , , devices \] required *-2 on the cars *T*-3 , uh , E_S ###that 's something that Europe did n't do *T*-1 right away E_S ###and now they 're doing that E_S ###and I guess 0 it started in the last few years because they have found that in that particular part of the country , that 's the only pollution that *T*-1 's been there . E_S ###It 's not an area that *T*-1 is industry E_S 
103111:26	###The best answer , of course , would be solar or , uh , fusion , or something clean . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Well , we 've got a problem on the line , do n't we . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] get that sometimes , um , E_S ###my line gets some static . E_S ###I do n't know why . E_S 
103120:6	###I do n't know why . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###But , uh , solar , of course , would be \[ the clean , \+ the cleanest . \] E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Well , I know 0 it 's MUMBLEx , um , N_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###SpeakerA41 . ###we did have a solar water heater when we lived in Houston *T*-1 E_S ###and , uh , oddly enough I thought 0 our part of the country was ideal . E_S 
103146:70	###but , uh , when we lived in Houston *T*-1 we had a solar water heater E_S ###and we had thought 0 this part of the country would be ideal for solar homes and solar energy E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Uh-huh . . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###and we have enough clouds that , uh , ###there are other areas that *T*-1 would be better suited . E_S ###That surprised me because I think , 0 we have a tremendous amount of , um , sunny days . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . 
103191:59	###\[ I , \+ I \] think , 0 with * solving some of the \[ energy , \+ future energy \] problems , we 'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Uh , I hope so . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###I do to . E_S ###I like *-1 to be optimistic , E_S ###I do n't like *-1 to be pessimistic about these things . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Well , I do think , um , N_S ###I mean , you 've already mentioned several things , I think , uh , just the change in attitude and the fact that more people are aware 0 there is a problem and more people are interested in , uh , N_S 
103268:27	###SpeakerB15 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it would never be equal , E_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###SpeakerB17 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###SpeakerB19 . ###Right . E_S ###Yeah . E_S 
103318:8	###SpeakerB35 . ###SpeakerA36 . ###and we need *-1 to have different punishments you know . E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###but I just am scared of capital punishment , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB39 . ###Yeah . ###Well I can underst- N_S 
103366:23	###SpeakerA56 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB57 . ###You know , everybody would be just as scared to death , you know . E_S ###\[ We , \+ we 've \] had a real problem *ICH*-1 here in Texas with , uh , prison overcrowding E_S ###and they 've been releasing people left and right E_S ###and , you know , they 've committed murders and rapes and everything else , E_S ###and , you know , you just think , you know , where 's the justice *T*-1 here . E_S ###SpeakerA58 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
103382:22	###and that was one of the questions E_S ###but , uh , I do know that they are notorious for *-1 paroling people . E_S ###SpeakerB61 . ###Oh , really ? E_S ###SpeakerA62 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ when they 're , \+ when , \] N_S ###and then * having them reconvicted *-1 for violent crimes . E_S ###SpeakerB63 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
103518:20	###and , uh , \[ I , \+ I \] enjoy orchestral classical music E_S ###and I enjoy classical guitar and classical piano , you know , E_S ###and \[ \[ that 's , \+ those are , \] \+ that 's \] my favorite type .

103603:15	###SpeakerA31 . ###Yeah , E_S ###small world . E_S ###So , \[ I , \+ uh , I \] know Chris . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah , E_S ###he 's a pretty nice guy . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Most of the time . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . 
103663:8	###SpeakerA49 . ###Of course . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###but , I think 0 it 's Elijah . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###It starts with an E . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Yeah , E_S 
103831:24	###and , um , \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] know if he 's really serious about it yet or not , you know , E_S ###it 's just one of those things 0 I 'm just going *-1 to wait and see if he 's interested in something *T*-2 , you know .

103953:42	###SpeakerB28 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###So , uh , you know , \[ \[ we , \+ when we go *-3 dump , \] \+ actually when we go *-1 dump \] our things *T*-2 , oh , we collect newspapers , too , and then take them , E_S ###* seems like \[ there 's a pretty well , \+ there 's a \[ p- , \+ pretty \] continual flow \] of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh-huh .

103973:97	###SpeakerA35 . ###Well , I guess 0 they will *?* shortly . E_S ###I , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###and I think \[ if , \+ uh , if \] we just start *-1 to put , you know , the nickel deposit on things , like , uh , * was the case years ago that , uh , it would have more immediate *ICH*-2 effect , uh , \[ than , \+ \] N_S ###because I remember *-1 searching ditches for beer bottles because they were worth money E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Oh , right . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###and it seems like beer drinkers are among the worst for *-1 throwing things out the window E_S 
104066:33	###they just take their hay and just build a big mound of it ###and it naturally , uh , composts or stores E_S ###and , uh , so all 0 you have *-1 to do *T*-2 is * just place it somewhere and churn it E_S ###and it will naturally decompose , uh , E_S ###so you just have *-1 to kind of keep in separated E_S ###and then , uh , who *T*-1 knows how they process it from there *T*-2 and what they turn it into *T*-3 , E_S ###but it 's certainly usable material . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S 
104115:30	###He does n't . E_S ###He maims them . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Yeah , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###So , E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Yeah , E_S ###he maims them pretty good , does n't he ? E_S 
104229:13	###SpeakerA57 . ###Yeah . E_S ###We seen THE LITTLE MERMAID , too . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###LITTLE MERMAID and PETER PAN I think 0 *T*-2 \[ are , \+ are \] his two favorites that we 've got *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###SpeakerA61 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
104276:6	###SpeakerA75 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###SpeakerA77 . ###That 's right . ###And then they go to the dollar movies . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###So . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###SpeakerB80 . 
104308:47	###SpeakerA87 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###but , other than that it just seems like it 's so expensive . E_S ###And then the popcorn and everything else , E_S ###you almost ca n't afford *-1 to do it . No matter what . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###Although we did actually get , N_S 
104333:30	###and Bob is his patient E_S ###and Bob follows him on vacation .

104398:73	###Have you all got the individual containers yet ? E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###No , E_S ###I read in the paper this week where maybe , N_S ###I do n't know if it \[ w- , \+ was , \] N_S ###I guess 0 maybe this week someone may start *-1 getting them if the truck that *T*-2 picks them up is outfitted *-3 in time . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###But , \[ it , \+ it \] should be starting , I would stay probably in the next month \[ if , \+ if \] everything goes that , N_S 
104408:81	###I 'm not sure all what we 're going *-1 to have *-2 to do *T*-3 , whether we have three separate containers , E_S ###I really do n't understand that part on what they 've told you *-1 to separate everything *T*-2 .

E_S ###They 're way behind schedule on that particular part of it . E_S ###They were fine on the \[ green , \+ big green containers \] E_S ###SpeakerB12 . 
104558:6	###SpeakerB20 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###I do n't get into books too often because I have so many things that I stay occupied with *T*-1 uh , on a general basis , E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Uh-huh .

104707:20	###Uh , there 's some , uh , N_S ###* take breast cancer , for instance . E_S ###It seems *-1 to be doing much more damage *RNR*-2 and affecting \[ much more pe- , \+ many more people *RNR*-2 \] than AIDS . E_S ###And yet , uh , more people die of it , E_S ###and yet the funding has already , uh , exceeded , E_S ###AIDS has more money than , uh , breast cancer . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Than , N_S ###well , that 's interesting , is n't it *?* , E_S ###yeah . E_S 
104713:4	###SpeakerB2 . ###Than , N_S ###well , that 's interesting , is n't it *?* , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###So , uh , N_S ###I mean , if it 's true . E_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ I 've , \] \+ I 've \] always heard these things . E_S ###I 've never bothered *-1 to dig it out and make * sure , E_S ###but , uh , I 've heard it on more than one documentary that , uh , they were complaining that whoever *T*-1 's sitting up there *-2 making these decisions or whatever institutions *T*-3 raise the money and , uh , N_S 
104831:13	###and they do have that at his place of employment E_S ###and neither of us have a problem with it . E_S ###We 've , ###particularly , like you said with the things that the airlines \[ and , \+ and \] such . N_S ###\[ It 's , \+ uh , it *EXP*-2 's \] a scary thing * to know that , uh , you just do n't know what people are doing *T*-1 uh , before they go to work . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###So , and \[ the , \+ the \] advertisements on television lately have been so , uh , N_S ###there have been so many . You know , E_S 
104852:13	###so I , N_S it 's very near and dear to me when we start *-1 talking about drug testing for random sampling and testing for cause , this type of thing *T*-2 . E_S ###And even in our field we have people that *-1 are in very high risk jobs E_S ###and we , at the present time , do not have random testing . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###And I am pushing towards that . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] honestly feel 0 if people have nothing 0 * to hide *T*-1 , they should n't have a problem with it . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Right . E_S 
104881:59	###Uh , \[ some people just , \+ uh , I 've heard some people just \] talking in our group of friends that they just feel 0 it 's an invasion of privacy and things like that , E_S ###but , uh , in the long run , it seems to me , 0 it 's kind of like what they keep *-1 talking *T*-2 about \[ the , \+ uh , the \] AIDS testing with doctors or dentists and things and how that , you know , N_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###they feel 0 that 's not fair and whatever , E_S ###but , you know , those kind of things I 'd like *-1 to know *T*-2 myself . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . 
104939:15	###and \[ it , \+ it \] sounded very positive . E_S ###And \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 it 's great . E_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ I \] would like , \+ I would encourage \] it . E_S ###I 'm pushing our company towards that . ###MUMBLEx . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Well , and , you know , if they do find someone \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-1 is , uh , having a problem with drugs E_S and they can get them the help that they need *T*-1 . As opposed to *-2 just letting the problem go on \[ with , \+ without \] any , uh , support . And whatever , N_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . 
104961:22	###but the crime rate here is just astronomical . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Ours is changing . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ ours , \+ ours \] is changing , E_S ###it 's increasing . E_S ###\[ I live in a , \+ I live in a \] very nice suburb E_S ###and \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ it 's \] unbelievable \[ \[ what , \+ what , \] \+ what *T*-1 's \] going on and \[ the drugs , \+ the selling of drugs . \] E_S ###\[ It 's just , \+ it 's just \] too loose . E_S ###It 's too free . E_S 
105071:26	###\[ I 've , \+ I 've , \] uh , done about all 0 I dare *-1 do *T*-2 on skis . ###You know , * skiing on one and jumping around here and there E_S ###and \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] know how you can get injured *-1 *-1 doing much more than that *T*-2 E_S ###and I just ca n't risk it right now *-1 being a head of the family and the breadwinner and all that . E_S ###* Just , uh , ca n't take the risk 0 I did *T*-1 as a dumb teenager , I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S ###So life just changes a little bit in that respect . E_S ###I 'd kind of like , someday , *-1 to maybe end up on a pair of skis \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-2 does n't have a , uh , well , N_S what they call *T*-3 trick skis . N_S ###They 'll allow you to ski backwards . E_S ###I have n't \[ cr- , \+ managed \] *-1 to get a hold on that , uh , craft yet , E_S ###but , uh , N_S 
105139:6	###and in the position 0 he 's in *T*-1 , they do n't care if I go along . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###So it 's great . E_S ###I just kind of join up when it 's something interesting *T*-1 E_S ###and uh , Disneyworld is the one for a week next year E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . 
105146:11	###SpeakerB18 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###SpeakerB20 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###and it will be at this time of the year E_S ###and this year \[ we 're leaving , \+ uh , uh , matter of fact we 're leaving \] next Saturday for New Orleans . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Oh , that will be fun , too . E_S 
105191:20	###SpeakerB32 . ###SpeakerA33 . ###Did you know that next week there 's several T V shows coming from there in celebration of their anniversary . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###No , E_S ###I know 0 this is a real good time 0 * to go *T*-1 , because they are having so many activities and special shows . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Well , and with a daughter , nine , it is just , N_S ###she 's old enough * to really grasp the meaning behind , N_S ###SpeakerB36 . 
105552:42	###SpeakerA63 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###SpeakerA65 . ###You know , I think 0 personally I 'm for it . E_S ###There 's several reason why \[ I , \+ I \] could think of *T*-1 right now why we should n't have it *T*-2 such as drug testing , E_S they say , runs approximately a thousand dollars a person every time 0 you do it *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Really ? E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###And , N_S 
105746:11	###\[ And , \+ but \] she does n't china paint E_S ###so we both have our expertise side . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###That is excellent . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###What part of Ohio are you in *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###\[ We 're in the sub- , \+ I 'm in the suburb \] of Cleveland E_S ###and I 'm about , uh , fifteen miles , probably , from downtown Cleveland , something like that . E_S ###And Cleveland is located *-1 right on Lake Erie E_S 
105759:6	###SpeakerB38 . ###Oh , what 's that *T*-1 , N_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###And you do find people , uh , into the crafts and \[ the things that , \+ uh , various things \] for spare time , E_S ###but , I have never heard *RNR*-1 and I have actually never run into *RNR*-1 anyone into the china painting E_S ###and I 'm just intrigued with it . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###If you ever start , * be sure and start with \[ a large piece that you can , \+ I mean a large flat plate . \] E_S ###Um , that way you can get the feel of , N_S ###you 're not cramped on these smaller objects . E_S 
105830:8	###but she enjoys * eating out , E_S ###so I have *-1 to share it with her . E_S ###And , uh , actually it 's very easy for me , because \[ I , \+ I \] \[ have a prac- , \+ make it a practice \] when I am out *T*-1 , E_S ###I eat differently than what I could eat *T*-1 at home or around here . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###So , I look for just about anything , E_S ###and \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ uh , it 's \] a lot of fun . E_S ###I do n't have *-1 to \[ worry , \+ really worry \] too much about price considerations because I , you know , N_S 
105920:45	###SpeakerA37 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###I mean , now there 's a new Italian place Sfuzi E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Okay , E_S ###I have a , N_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###\[ that has a great , \+ I 've not been there , but it has a great \] reputation as one of the best restaurants in Dallas , E_S ###and now there 's one in Addison . E_S 
105942:35	###SpeakerA45 . ###I 've been there . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Now I really like Copelands . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Okay , E_S ###I 've been there . E_S ###Um , one down there is \[ the , \+ uh , ###I think 0 it 's an \] old schoolhouse . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . 
105970:8	###SpeakerA55 . ###That 's it , E_S ###that 's it . E_S ###I 've had excellent food there . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###See , \[ I , \+ when I \] went *T*-1 , I thought , N_S ###the people drove me crazy first of all E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###True . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . 
106130:27	###so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###so she did n't have * to be transported *-1 back and forth . E_S ###So , she 's been there since August the thirteenth and seems *-1 to have adjusted pretty well . E_S ###It 's not her favorite place 0 * to be in *T*-1 . E_S ###She 'd much rather be here with me . E_S ###But when it got to the point 0 I was spending more time at the hospital with her *T*-2 *T*-1 , N_S ###SpeakerB30 . 
106148:24	###SpeakerB34 . ###Right , E_S ###and that becomes difficult then . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###So . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###SpeakerA37 . ###She was falling down and hemorrhaging E_S ###and , you know , all kinds of physical problems , E_S ###so it just became too much 0 for me to handle *T*-1 , E_S 
106204:37	###SpeakerB58 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###and I know 0 she 's eating the right things , E_S ###and her doctor 's right there where he can come in and check on her *T*-1 , E_S ###so . It *ICH*-2 became dangerous for us * to keep *-1 transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Yep . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###so , I think 0 she 'll adjust , E_S 
106592:8	###SpeakerB42 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###and so everybody 's saying , you 're kidding , ###you have two cars the same , E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . ###and I said , you know how when you have a bad one *T*-1 , you say , never again *T*-2 E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###That 's right . E_S 
106933:49	###SpeakerA1 . ###So do you have any recycling programs there ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Um , I do n't really think 0 we have anything in the works as of yet . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh , we 're a pretty small town E_S ###and , uh , the closest thing 0 we have *T*-1 are bins like out in front of Wal-Mart that *T*-2 show , you know , plastics , paper liter bottles , et cetera , et cetera . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . 
107108:6	###SpeakerB74 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###So , when you see something that *T*-1 's on recycled paper *T*-2 , they 've actually gone to a lot of expense *-3 to do that . E_S ###It 's , uh , N_S ###they 're not coming out *-1 ahead at all . E_S ###\[ It 's , \+ uh , it 's \] really a cost . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###Huh . I was n't totally aware of that . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . 
107188:6	###and my mother has four brothers and two sisters . E_S ###So I ca- , N_S ###both of my parents had big families , E_S ###and \[ we always wer- , \+ we always got \] together , just always . E_S ###Now it 's different because I live here E_S ###and I , N_S ###you know , when I go home *T*-2 I try *-1 to see the families , as much of the family as I can *?* E_S ###but it 's real different . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Yes . E_S 
107189:8	###So I ca- , N_S ###both of my parents had big families , E_S ###and \[ we always wer- , \+ we always got \] together , just always . E_S ###Now it 's different because I live here E_S ###and I , N_S ###you know , when I go home *T*-2 I try *-1 to see the families , as much of the family as I can *?* E_S ###but it 's real different . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . 
107217:8	###and we met in Florida . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###So the seven of us went on a cruise and then went to Disney together . E_S ###So that 's all the family , E_S ###so * planning our family \[ reunio- , \+ reunion \] was very easy , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I guess so . E_S 
107380:44	###SpeakerB56 . ###* Sounds like i- , N_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###SpeakerB58 . ###No , E_S ###no . E_S ###Afraid not . E_S ###Uh , hopefully they 'll give a subject 0 I like *T*-1 *ICH*-3 one of these times . Something 0 I really know a lot about *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Right . E_S 
107465:8	###SpeakerB20 . ###Absolutely . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###It is , um , N_S ###I do n't know why we are so complacent *T*-1 , E_S ###but I 'm going *-1 to vote each time . E_S ###* Right or wrong I 'm going *-1 to cast a ballot E_S ###and then if I 'm unhappy with it , I have the right * to express my opinion . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###That 's right . E_S 
107635:8	###so it gets , N_S ###I do n't know . E_S ###\[ It 's , \+ it 's \] a hard decision , E_S ###but I do n't think 0 I would do it to my parents personally . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###I know at this , N_S ###I know 0 I feel like I would never do that with my parents either , you know . E_S ###But \[ I , \+ I \] really feel bad for the people 0 I see *T*-1 th- , ###not very , N_S ###I 'm not \[ really , \+ really \] experienced E_S 
107647:44	###But , N_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###When he retired *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and he 's got , you know , seven brothers and sisters E_S ###\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , he 's the one because he 's the one that * is n't going to work every day and that she moved in with *T*-2 when she needed *-3 to move in with someone *T*-4 . E_S ###And , N_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah , E_S 
107715:6	###And , you know , it 's ###I , N_S I 'm not saying that I do either E_S ###but you know , it 's just funny E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###\[ and , \+ and \] we really do n't have any that *T*-1 do n't have the Social Security E_S and everything ###* really is n't that much for elderly people 0 * to live on *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
107870:6	###SpeakerA45 . ###You 're right . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###So , as I understand it here , if there 's anything , they 'll call off schools \[ and , \+ and \] close businesses . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Well , they get ice , E_S ###and no one can drive on ice . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . 
107920:47	###SpeakerA7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###The , um , thing \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 distinguishes me a lot of the time when I have *-2 to dress real professionally for a meeting or something *T*-3 is 0 I wear a clerical collar and a suit and , uh , all of that sort of thing , E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###but when I do n't need *-1 to dress up for \[ a , \+ a \] meeting or a service of some sort *T*-2 , I do n't . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
107999:11	###so he has *-1 to dress , E_S ###and he just really hates it , E_S ###they have the long sleeve shirts and the whole tie and the whole suit , E_S ###and even when his job is not going *-1 to be with people all day long *T*-2 , he said 0 it *EXP*-4 's just part of the uniform and the expected image that they have *-3 to dress . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ that 's , \+ around here in a lot of places that 's \] the way 0 it is *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB42 .

108125:9	###well , I like shows like GROWING PAINS E_S ###and , uh , what 's the other one *T*-1 now , ###they moved from Tuesday night to Wednesday night , E_S ###so I do n't get *-1 to watch it very much .

E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 it 's just like anything else , a new concept , you know , E_S ###as I said , if I have *-1 to go to a testing area with my urine specimen I was insulted *-2 , E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it is *?* , E_S

110892:29	###I think 0 they rank about forty-ninth E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###but our children got a very good education there E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Uh-huh .

110958:9	###so , that 's interesting , E_S ###but , \[ he , \+ his \] grades , I have n't seen them yet , E_S ###but supposedly they 're good , E_S ###so , N_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###Yes , E_S ###you always hear how good . E_S ###Now my son 's at , junior high and says that his grades are going *-1 to be wonderful E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###SpeakerA83 . 
111040:8	###and it sort of gets away from me if you 're not with it . E_S ###SpeakerA24 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA26 . ###The grass not growing so fast . E_S ###SpeakerB27 . 
111163:8	###I really enjoy it there . The landscaping , the homes , the architecture , the whole thing ###very enjoyable gardens , E_S ###SpeakerA74 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB75 . ###and my wife and I , N_S ###SpeakerA76 . ###Except for the lack of trees , out where we are *T*-1 . ###It was all cotton fields , E_S ###SpeakerB77 . 
111208:8	###She 's about seven or eight years old . E_S ###I got her for Christmas from my family , \[ and , \+ \] uh , back when we lived in Nebraska *T*-1 . E_S ###I like *-1 to hunt , E_S ###and , uh , so , I thought that if I had a good hunting dog like Thumper that , boy , I could just go out and get all kinds of game . E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Did it work ? . E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###Yeah , E_S ###except we live in Plano , Texas now E_S ###SpeakerB5 . 
111243:13	###SpeakerB13 . ###Just , N_S ###um , I got him , N_S ###\[ he was , \+ um , he was \] born *-1 in the wild , like \[ in a , \+ in a \] shed and had never been in a building when I got him *T*-2 .

E_S 
111362:6	###And I did n't realize it , E_S ###but this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier , bought the dog , E_S ###and she was in the back room , E_S ###and so that night we had a reception for some of the , uh , potential high school students or college students , E_S ###\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , he had the dog the whole time in his room , E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] I had no idea .

111433:39	###and on * going out , I like steaks . E_S ###So , we try *-1 to hit those places when we can *?* *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###When we travel *T*-1 we look for Wendy 's because we have kids , E_S ###and my husband and I like *-1 getting the salads or the lighter meals E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###and then that way they can get their burgers and fries E_S ###and we can have a salad bar E_S 
111462:6	###He likes their milk shakes and their chili cheese dogs , I guess 0 *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###so he 's a fan \[ of , \+ of \] Dairy Queen , E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] we 'll go even in town here at times , just as \[ a , \+ a \] change although I 'm not that excited about it . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###But \[ we 've eat , \+ we eat \] out so much 0 it 's gotten so I do n't like *-2 to really eat any place E_S 
111559:8	###and they 've got a nice patio area that you can wait and get something 0 * to drink *T*-1 *T*-2 , unless you get there at five o'clock , E_S ###then you can go right through . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###But they have real good signature salads *ICH*-1 there and nice steaks , E_S ###so , that 's our nice place 0 * to go *T*-1 . E_S ###We do n't usually take the kids when we go there *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###But well , we do n't go out that much , E_S

111865:6	###SpeakerB40 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###And we go to On the Border . And lots of places that *T*-1 have , uh , I think MUMBLEx N_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA13 . 
117587:31	###And I came home E_S ###and he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Oh , my word .

117923:42	###SpeakerA19 . ###SpeakerB20 . ###And then * start *-1 getting into these Nissans and the like N_S ###and I just ca n't keep up . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] agree . E_S ###About all 0 I ever , N_S ###I never was too mechanically inclined , E_S ###but I used *-1 to always change my own oil and do the points and plugs and , N_S 
117994:10	###SpeakerA47 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###And because the parking brake had n't been used *-1 in so many years , the piston froze up . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Oh .

118042:4	###SpeakerB62 . ###Well , that is one problem , E_S ###but also \[ these , \+ uh , these \] fast oil change places , you just ca n't beat them . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###That 's true .

124005:61	###SpeakerB4 . ###Yes , E_S ###I agree . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###I know , 0 \[ they , \+ they \] did a , N_S ###it was on a talk show , E_S ###they took , uh , the parents and then \[ the , \+ uh , the \] son , E_S ###and they compared income at different points in time \[ when the , \+ when the \] father \[ was , \+ you know , was \] a little bit younger and more in his heyday *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
124367:6	###Well , the Rangers really , uh , knocked the socks off of them , which you would expect *T*-1 you know , anyway , E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###but Nolan I think 0 *T*-2 took himself out after a couple of innings *ICH*-1 or something , you know , of the game E_S ###so , N_S ###SpeakerB1 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA2 . ###So what do you , uh , think 0 *T*-1 is \[ the , \+ uh , the \] worst culprit for air pollution ? E_S 
124404:8	###and it got hydrocarbons in there . E_S ###It 's a very clean , uh , fire extinguisher , E_S ###but it 's , you know , really bad on the environment . E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Huh . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###I guess 0 I missed that one . E_S ###Uh . E_S ###SpeakerA14 . 
124436:22	###and so \[ that 's , \+ you know , that 's \] the way 0 they 're dealing with it here *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB23 . ###SpeakerA24 . ###Yeah , uh , E_S ###yeah E_S ###I guess 0 that was just mainly in the cities there , E_S ###and as far as where I live *T*-1 , I do n't have *-2 to do that , E_S ###but I have an old car which I doubt 0 *T*-1 \[ would , \+ uh , would , \] uh , pass the inspection , a seventy-six , E_S 
124487:62	###And it sounds real neat . E_S ###I have n't seen them priced *-1 anywhere yet , E_S ###but \[ that , \+ that \] sounds like that might help *-1 solve that problem even on you know , \[ \[ old , \+ old , \] \+ uh , older \] stoves that *T*-2 do n't have any kind of E P A requirements on them . E_S ###SpeakerA40 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB41 . ###That might help a little bit , especially in some places . E_S ###We 're really lucky here . E_S ###We have a prevailing southerly wind that *T*-1 blows just about everything out . E_S ###SpeakerA42 . 
124540:38	###and our head football coach , Dennis Muir , used *-1 to be an assistant coach at B Y U . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Oh , really .

E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh , Northern State University in Aberdeen , South Dakota . E_S 
124575:16	###SpeakerB16 . ###Forever . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###SpeakerB18 . ###* Seems like *?* , anyways .

N_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###You know , I read a study once , E_S 
124614:45	###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Is that , what was yours more like *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Was there a , N_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###it was about twenty-six to one . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . 
124704:16	###Um * let 's see . ###My advice would be * to pick a major before you get into college E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###That 's excellent advice .

124848:25	###\[ so \+ and \] I have that for automotive purposes . E_S ###SpeakerB45 . ###Uh-huh , ###um . E_S ###SpeakerA46 . ###SpeakerB47 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###Well , well that 's great . E_S ###Um , everyone 0 I know *T*-1 here uses , um , credit cards like they 're going out of business * to be honest with you . E_S 
124949:4	###SpeakerB83 . ###Yeah , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerA84 . ###Okay , then . E_S ###Well , bye now . E_S ###SpeakerB85 . ###\[ O- , \+ okay , \] E_S ###bye-bye . E_S ###SpeakerA1 .

125217:21	###SpeakerB2 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###Uh , \[ I suspect , \+ I take \] the view that * cutting income tax rates has been good for \[ the , \+ the \] economy , that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden in various kinds of sales taxes , uh , energy taxes , particularly , and that to the extent 0 we need *-1 to raise more taxes *T*-3 , that 's the direction 0 we should look *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . 
125241:80	###SpeakerB8 . ###Uh-huh .

125406:8	###SpeakerA21 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###and we know a lot of people at the church E_S ###so I would feel very confident with *-1 leaving my child there .

125435:45	###Um , when your child 's a little bit older , like a three year old *T*-3 you 'd be more concerned with if there 's a type of care that it *EXP*-2 's torture for them to lay down and take a nap *T*-1 .

128962:16	###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah , E_S ###see , that 's how it is *T*-1 in Texas , too E_S ###because when it 's cold *T*-1 , it 's really cold . E_S ###So , N_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I do n't think 0 there is any mountains 0 *T*-1 to stop the wind . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###What 's that *T*-1 ? E_S 
128978:8	###SpeakerB28 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 that 's true .

E_S ###SpeakerA31 . 
129184:7	###Maybe not . E_S ###I think 0 she graduated around then , too , though , eighty-seven probably , E_S ###but , she got her doc- , N_S ###SpeakerB110 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , I ca n't , N_S ###there are so many girls in all my classes , E_S ###I ca n't remember how many people . E_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###Yeah , E_S 
129288:42	###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah , E_S ###although , you know , it 's not really revenge because it does n't mean anything to him . E_S ###You know , \[ he , \+ he \] has no concept of what he has done *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Really ? E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###He just , ###well , N_S from what I can tell *T*-1 . ###I mean , I did n't talk to the guy or anything , E_S 
129396:6	###SpeakerA79 . ###Wow . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Uh , and in Texas \[ there is , \+ there is \] a couple of questions 0 you have *-1 to ask *T*-2 , uh , in the punishment phase . E_S ###Uh , for example , was the guy provoked *-1 ###and was the response reasonable given the provocation . E_S ###And there is a number of questions E_S ###and just depending on whether you say yes or no , uh , \[ you , \+ you \] can give him capital punishment E_S ###and if you 're up to the point where if he still qualifies for capital punishment *T*-1 , then you can look at mitigating circumstances . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . 
129411:10	###SpeakerA83 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and I 'm really kind of against life in prison anyway because it costs so dog gone much . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###SpeakerB86 . ###Right , E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] to me , I mean , you take away a person 's freedom , you 've taken away most of their life . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . 
129639:11	###SpeakerB59 . ###Oh , \[ in , \+ uh , Is it in \] Dallas ? E_S ###SpeakerA60 . ###\[ It 's , \+ it 's \] just \[ a , uh , c- , \+ a cafe , \] E_S ###so it 's not really anything *ICH*-1 , you know , that I want *-2 to , N_S ###it 's not the same . E_S ###SpeakerB61 . ###SpeakerA62 . ###Uh , it 's in Lewisville . E_S ###SpeakerB63 . 
129689:42	###SpeakerA1 . ###I guess 0 we 're supposed *-1 to talk about what *T*-2 's being done *-3 about recycling . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Well , lots , right ? E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Finally . E_S 
130012:6	###SpeakerA11 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh , \[ and , \+ you know , and \] here , with our court system \[ and , \+ and \] ways of * sort of screwing it around and stuff \[ you can , \+ you can \] kind of always count on the fact , N_S ###\[ or , \+ or \] there is a good chance 0 you 're going *-1 to get off . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###And also , it does n't seem like it does that many harm , E_S ###I mean , sure , their life is taken *-1 , E_S ###but they 'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway , E_S 
130206:52	###And we have a truck , E_S ###so probably a economic size car or , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###What kind of a car do you have *T*-1 now ? E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Right now I have a eighty-seven Cavalier .

130215:6	###because , uh , I drive out of town a lot of the weekends E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###and , uh , I would like my next car to have good gas mileage . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###And , uh , same here , uh , E_S ###you know , a nice car , American made N_S 
130240:9	###so , Something \[ with a , \+ \] that *T*-1 's not too sporty because of insurance , then . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Oh , I know . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###SpeakerA23 . ###Right , E_S ###that insurance does come into play . E_S ###I forgot about that . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah . E_S 
130266:14	###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###it is *?* , E_S ###so , N_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###But , N_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###And * the more expensive 0 the car *?* *T*-1 , the higher it is *T*-2 E_S ###so , Unless I win the lottery , I wo n't be driving , anything too expensive . E_S 
130426:4	###SpeakerB94 . ###Oh , I 'm sure , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###\[ I could , \+ I could \] see why . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###So , you been down here before ? E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###Yep . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###Really ? E_S 
130459:28	###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , E_S ###we 're supposed *-1 to talk about vacations . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Right , E_S ###so , uh , well , uh , what kind of vacations do you like *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Well , uh , I have n't been to many places , E_S ###but I have a opportunity * to go to , uh , Paris , France , uh , \[ with , \+ uh , with \] my friend in April . E_S ###\[ She is , \+ \[ her , \+ uh , her \] family , you know , lives \] there , E_S 
130471:6	###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###so \[ I 'm hoping *-1 to g- , \+ I 'm praying 0 I get *-2 to go . \] Uh , E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Oh , that 's great .

130751:4	###SpeakerB41 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###everybody does newspapers . E_S ###SpeakerA42 . ###But , \[ that , \+ that \] kind of stuff . E_S ###SpeakerB43 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA44 . ###But \[ they , \+ they \] said 0 they ca n't be smashed or else , uh , E_S it does n't fit in their little containers E_S 
130755:4	###SpeakerA42 . ###But , \[ that , \+ that \] kind of stuff . E_S ###SpeakerB43 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA44 . ###But \[ they , \+ they \] said 0 they ca n't be smashed or else , uh , E_S it does n't fit in their little containers E_S ###and they 're not reimbursed *-1 by \[ the , \+ the \] people who *T*-2 are over them or something . E_S ###SpeakerB45 . ###Well , shoot , maybe what we ought *-1 to do *T*-2 is *-1 start *-3 sending unsmashed , uh , Pepsi cans and whatever up there . E_S ###SpeakerA46 . 
131267:55	###SpeakerB84 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###and they 're probably , N_S ###I 'm sure , 0 in Dallas since you 're big places , a lot more women are , uh , working right out of their home with their P C 's or with their lap computers or whatever . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I 've \] heard of that . E_S ###Uh , I have n't really talked to anybody that *T*-1 's , you know , too involved with that . E_S ###But , I mean , I think 0 that is a , N_S 
131661:57	###SpeakerA147 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB148 . ###So when another group \[ of , \+ of , \] uh , people step in , try *-1 to do it *T*-2 , \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] tromping on our territory , so * to speak , E_S ###so N_S ###SpeakerA149 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB150 . ###I firmly believe that , uh , E_S ###SpeakerA1 . 
131715:55	###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . ###\[ but , \+ but , \] uh , all 0 they did *T*-1 every day in their life was * to play golf every , N_S ###they 'd leave work and go to a golf course , or a little country club *ICH*-2 0 they belonged to *T*-1 back in Richmond , Virginia and just , uh , play nine holes of golf . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###That was their deal , E_S ###they , N_S ###SpeakerB24 . 
131801:6	###SpeakerA49 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Uh , so , N_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###That 's super . E_S ###I have n't learned *-1 to hit the ball easy E_S ###and I just sort of , N_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###SpeakerA53 . 
131853:49	###SpeakerB66 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###absolutely . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###And , uh , I still remember that *-1 watching myself and my son E_S ###\[ so , \+ but \] I think 0 the key is 0 \[ you just need *-1 to , \+ you need *-2 to \] play more often than I play . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , \[ I , \+ I \] read recently here , \[ 0 they say , \+ \] 0 \[ if you 're playing , \+ if you 're \] scoring well , you should play more . E_S ###If you 're scoring poorly , you should spend more time on the practice \[ g- , \+ uh , range . \] E_S 
131859:32	###SpeakerB68 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , \[ I , \+ I \] read recently here , \[ 0 they say , \+ \] 0 \[ if you 're playing , \+ if you 're \] scoring well , you should play more . E_S ###If you 're scoring poorly , you should spend more time on the practice \[ g- , \+ uh , range . \] E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Uh , I think 0 there is less \[ flus- , \+ frustration \] factor there , too , uh , E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###* \[ Makes good , \+ makes good \] sense . E_S 
131872:8	###Apparently they 're very difficult 0 * to play with *T*-1 , E_S ###but with practice , I would imagine 0 you could groove that swing , too . E_S ###And I play with a fellow that *T*-1 can knock a one iron , E_S ###it 's incredible . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###\[ \[ And , \+ but , \] \+ and \] his accuracy *ICH*-2 is what *T*-1 's so startling with it . E_S ###And I , N_S ###\[ and it , \+ but it 's \] an iron that he 's really practiced with *T*-1 . E_S 
131889:32	###if I can get off the first tee when everyone 's standing around *-1 watching you *T*-2 , I 'd be , great after that . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###SpeakerA79 . ###That , boy , N_S ###I just , N_S ###if I get off the tee box \[ and I , \+ and I 've , \] you know , you know , anything from a hundred fifty to two hundred yard drive through a straight , I just want *-1 to get down and kiss the ground , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###And get away without * embarrassing yourself , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . 
131984:17	###SpeakerB35 . ###Uh , yeah , E_S ###unfortunately the little portable P C that *T*-1 was plugged *-2 on the back was only a seven and a half megahertz , \[ eighty , \+ eighty-six . \] E_S ###It 's like slow . E_S ###SpeakerA36 . ###Yep , E_S ###\[ that will , \+ that will , \] slow you up . E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###SpeakerA38 . ###SpeakerB39 . 
132012:11	###And my notebook is somewhere around here . E_S ###See if I can make my telephone cord stretch far enough . E_S ###SpeakerA48 . ###0 I 've tried *-1 to do *T*-2 is * get this outfit to give me one . E_S ###SpeakerB49 . ###Uh , he 's , uh , up in , N_S ###SpeakerA50 . ###SpeakerB51 . ###Huh ?

132043:29	###SpeakerA62 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB63 . ###Okay , E_S ###he 's , uh , uh , south of Renner \[ on , \+ on \] Custer .

132132:11	###SpeakerA98 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I was kind of surprised how rapidly they bypassed , the three eighty-six *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB99 . ###SpeakerA100 . ###That was n't alive for but maybe two years . E_S ###SpeakerB101 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Well , I thought 0 was funny that they kept *-1 pushing the three eighty-six S X even though \[ the , \+ the \] price difference is about ten dollars . E_S ###SpeakerA102 . 
132141:79	###SpeakerA102 . ###Is that right ? E_S ###That 's it ? E_S ###SpeakerB103 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ it , \+ when it \] comes on the manufacturing floor *T*-1 it 's about ten bucks . E_S ###SpeakerA104 . ###I 'll be darned . E_S ###SpeakerB105 . ###Yeah . E_S 
132173:55	###I , *-1 being in my own business , uh , N_S ###in the last six years , every year there 's been at least minimum twenty-five percent increase in health insurance costs , E_S ###and I think eventually 0 the number of people that *T*-1 can afford health insurance , \[ as , \+ as \] it is now getting squeezed *-2 and squeezed *-2 tighter . N_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Uh , I think 0 they 're asking for it . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 the medical profession is \[ just , \+ just \] pushing until there 's no option but 0 the government take it over E_S ###and , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB8 . 
132181:33	###and , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Do you think that it 's just , uh , medical guys ? E_S ###What about , you know , you know how expensive new equipment and technology is *T*-1 .

E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Well , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 a lot of it is , uh *?* , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] do n't disagree totally with that , E_S ###but , uh , my wife this last summer , uh , when we were on vacation *T*-1 tore up her knee , E_S ###and , uh , uh , it was \[ lig- , \+ ligaments , \] uh , in her knee , as it turned out , uh , E_S

132203:16	###Well , she goes in , E_S ###he says , well , I think 0 this is what it is *T*-1 , E_S ###but , uh , you better go to the hospital and have one of these M R I things .

132248:36	###If the doctor makes a mistake , he can be sure that he 's going *-1 to be hauled *-2 into court .

133275:6	###but I 'm just speaking overall across the country . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Something is definitely wrong . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
133283:4	###SpeakerB22 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###And , uh , one thing , they do n't spend as much time *-1 just teaching reading and writing , E_S ###so a lot of kids are just being promoted *-1 from year to year E_S ###and they truly ca n't read E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###so I do n't know how they expect them to , uh , pass history *T*-2 when they ca n't read anything , you know , even read a word problem in math *T*-1 . E_S 
133295:6	###SpeakerB26 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###But , um , N_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###So \[ do you , \+ what *ICH*-2 do you \] think 0 *T*-1 is good about the schools ? E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###That *T*-1 is good about , N_S ###well , it depends on where you are *T*-1 . E_S ###They 're all so different . E_S 
133326:49	###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###or is how you end up *T*-1 . N_S ###Overall , Arlington is good , one of the better ones in the state , E_S ###so I guess 0 we lucked out when we moved here *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###So , yeah , E_S ###that 's the thing is * just to look at the school system in the area that you move into *T*-1 before you . N_S 
133331:9	###so I guess 0 we lucked out when we moved here *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###So , yeah , E_S ###that 's the thing is * just to look at the school system in the area that you move into *T*-1 before you . N_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Of course we have a slight problem in that , uh , the number of the illiterate in America is mushrooming at this point , E_S ###and , uh , you know , where our kids might be in a great school *T*-1 , we 're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who *T*-2 are on welfare and unemployment because they ca n't read , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . 
133336:13	###SpeakerA41 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Of course we have a slight problem in that , uh , the number of the illiterate in America is mushrooming at this point , E_S ###and , uh , you know , where our kids might be in a great school *T*-1 , we 're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who *T*-2 are on welfare and unemployment because they ca n't read , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###So . N_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###But do you think that there should be , um , nationwide , um , curriculum ? E_S 
133360:52	###SpeakerB50 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] pretty low that there 's forty-eight countries *ICH*-1 ahead of us that *T*-2 have \[ more peop- , \+ more citizens *ICH*-3 \] percentage wise that *T*-4 can read and write , E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###so , um , unless we want *-1 to keep *-2 \[ paying , \+ paying \] for these people that *T*-3 ca n't make it in society , we 're going *-4 to have *-5 to do something . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Who do you think 0 it should be done *-1 through *T*-2 ? . 
133410:9	###and you die from it . E_S ###So I think that , uh , they need *-1 to look into it E_S ###and it 's kind of like cancer . E_S ###I do n't , you know , N_S ###how many years have we tried *-1 to find a cure for cancer *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###I think 0 it 'll probably be as difficult . E_S ###Uh , how about yourself . E_S 
133449:6	###SpeakerA16 . ###I do n't know . E_S ###I 've just heard it on the radio . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###Sometimes you hear things \[ that , \+ on the radio that , \] you know , *T*-1 could be true or could n't be *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA20 . 
133536:20	###and , N_S ###SpeakerB49 . ###Um , yeah , E_S ###\[ that 's , \+ that 's \] basically it , that , um , the immune system can at first slow down , E_S ###and the white blood cell count goes down , E_S ###\[ which *T*-1 is , \+ that 's \] AIDS Related Complex , E_S ###but then when things get completely out of control and it basically hits bottom *T*-1 , that 's AIDS E_S ###SpeakerA50 . ###And , N_S ###SpeakerB51 . 
133541:14	###\[ which *T*-1 is , \+ that 's \] AIDS Related Complex , E_S ###but then when things get completely out of control and it basically hits bottom *T*-1 , that 's AIDS E_S ###SpeakerA50 . ###And , N_S ###SpeakerB51 . ###and in that case , you know , people are prone to *-2 getting any kind of , you know , weird cancer that only animals got *T*-1 before E_S ###SpeakerA52 . ###Oh , really . E_S ###SpeakerB53 . ###and , N_S 
133565:20	###SpeakerB7 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] think that you 're absolutely right there . E_S ###0 The other thing is *T*-1 , is that we 've got \[ \[ these , \+ um , these , \] \+ all these \] bank defaults going on , \[ and , \+ and \] savings and loan defaults , \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA8 . ###And that effectively adds to whether it 's officially on the books or not . E_S ###SpeakerB9 . ###Right . E_S ###Exactly . ###Um , E_S 
133569:13	###SpeakerA8 . ###And that effectively adds to whether it 's officially on the books or not . E_S ###SpeakerB9 . ###Right . E_S ###Exactly . ###Um , E_S ###SpeakerA10 . ###And that 's got *-1 to be paid *-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###Exactly , E_S 
133598:6	###and if they have more money 0 * to spend *T*-1 , then that will be a spur to productivity , particularly commercial productivity , uh , which in turn *T*-2 will generate revenue . E_S ###But \[ it , \+ it \] seems \[ like , \+ like , \] uh , it 's sort of \[ \[ a , \+ uh , a sp- , \] \+ an unending spiral , \] E_S ###and \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ it , \] uh , N_S ###\[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] not sure that there 's any real genuine truth to \[ the , \+ uh , the \] idea \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ uh , that \] * decreasing taxes , particularly the kinds that *T*-1 are being recommended *-2 bye-bye the Bush administration and things like capital gains taxes and so forth is going *-4 to , uh , result in substantial amounts of money , you know , 0 for consumers to spend *T*-3 . E_S ###And , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I 'm not sure how I feel *T*-3 about *-2 paying on \[ the quest , \+ the long term quests \] that tax cuts are worth *T*-1 at this point . E_S ###It 's probably a judgment of how bad the recession is *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB19 . 
133607:31	###SpeakerB19 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ it , \+ uh , it \] would seem to me that there are other things that the administration could do *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###Well , well , first of all you look to the Fed *-1 to fight the recession as indeed it has *?* , with interest rates . E_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###SpeakerB23 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
133637:85	###SpeakerB31 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerA32 . ###But there are various other areas such \[ as , \+ as \] farm subsidies that *T*-2 ought *-1 to be slashed *-1 . E_S ###Uh , a lot of entitlement programs , like education aid , I think , uh , 0 they should put \[ a , \+ in \] N_S ###the Reagan administration took all such entitlements to the poor but left them for the middle class , uh , E_S ###SpeakerB33 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA34 . ###in the longer term , uh , \[ \[ we , \+ we , \] \+ we 'd \] do well , I think 0 *T*-2 *-1 \[ to make , \+ to make , \] uh , reductions there . E_S 
133653:4	###SpeakerA36 . ###A lot of education aid has gone to so-called trade schools which *T*-1 are sort of not colleges E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###but schools that *T*-1 teach you trades , you know , beautician well , \[ and \+ \] often exists only because of the federal programs that they can take people and tell them 0 they can get loans for their full tuition *T*-3 , uh , and the school gets paid *-2 off immediately *T*-3 , uh E_S ###SpeakerB39 . ###Oh , \[ I see , \+ I see \] what you 're saying *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA40 . ###SpeakerB41 . 
133809:6	###SpeakerA59 . ###It 's pink . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Pink , E_S ###okay . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###It 's kind of got , uh , oh , just kind of a worn look to it . E_S ###I do n't know even how *-1 to say *T*-2 , N_S ###* just did n't turn out quite as nice as I would have liked E_S ###but , N_S 
133875:17	###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###And so a lot is wasted *-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###Normally it will tell you on the roll how often a pattern repeats *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###So you know how . N_S ###See , I did n't even think *-1 to look for that . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . 
133881:36	###SpeakerA89 . ###So you know how . N_S ###See , I did n't even think *-1 to look for that . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###And then the , N_S ###one of them was just a \[ different color , \+ different color \] pink , is what it ended up *-1 being *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###Um . E_S 
134015:43	###And I really know what the budget is *T*-1 , E_S ###\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , uh , when they were saying 0 we were so poor and they could n't pay taxes , and pay people their income tax refunds and things like that *T*-1 , E_S ###and , you know , I 'm well aware of the billions of assets that the state has *T*-1 , E_S ###and \[ it , \+ it 's \] just funny .

134361:114	###or does it come mostly from industry up there ?

134537:162	###SpeakerB59 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA60 . ###SpeakerB61 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA62 . ###So . N_S ###SpeakerB63 . ###Right . E_S ###Well , I put , N_S

134844:4	###SpeakerA93 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###SpeakerA95 . ###I think 0 we went through him though *-1 to get to Gorbachev on a lot of subjects E_S ###so , N_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###But that way , you ca n't never tell that . E_S 
134879:118	###SpeakerA7 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###So , it 's got real high ceilings on half the house E_S ###and the other half is just standard sized ceilings . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###And , uh , it 's about a five year old house now . E_S ###SpeakerA11 .

E_S ###SpeakerA119 . ###SpeakerB120 . ###Oh , gee . E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###So , I do n't know . E_S ###I mean , you got *-1 to wonder how long they 're going *-2 to keep *-3 doing that for *T*-4 . E_S 
136505:35	###SpeakerA35 . ###SpeakerB36 . ###SpeakerA37 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###that would be just too much of a fall for me . E_S ###Um , have you been , uh , N_S ###\[ was , \+ was \] the house reasonably new , E_S ###or you been doing some remodeling work on it . E_S ###SpeakerB38 .

136527:4	###We 're just on a concrete slab , you know E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Yeah .

136538:31	###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###SpeakerA49 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###and so during the dry season you have *-1 to water the foundation *-1 to keep your foundation \[ from , \+ uh , from , \] uh , *-2 drooping E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . 
136658:11	###SpeakerA25 . ###Oh , well , that 's nice . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###So , two nights a week for four hours we 're stuck together E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###You 're stuck together . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###and there 's usually not very much business . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###No . E_S

137003:6	###and , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] really neat . E_S ###I do n't think , uh , 0 hardly anybody lives there , E_S ###because it 's just kind of like , you know , tourists .

137090:8	###and that 's real pretty over there too . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###But I think 0 I 'm kind of a summer vacationer . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###me too , uh , E_S ###me too . E_S ###Unless I 'm going somewhere warm for the winter . E_S 
137149:11	###so it 's been a while since we 've had Barbie things . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###It 's been a while since they 've , uh , gone through the Barbie stuff MUMBLEx . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###But \[ we did have Barbies , \+ we did have Barbies \] and things , E_S ###and there N_S ###* seems to me \[ that \+ that \] became a craze when she was already , oh , like , you know , third , fourth , fifth grade *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . 
137685:6	###And , N_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Who is the competition going *-1 to be *T*-2 ? E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Well , it 's supposed *-1 to be the Redskins , ###but you know , we beat them already . E_S ###We beat them this year \[ in , \+ in \] Washington E_S ###\[ so , \+ you know , so \] everybody has the feeling like we can go all the way to the Super Bowl , E_S ###but , you know , it 's just that we have *-1 to play every game away , you know , E_S ###it 's going *-1 to be tough , E_S 
137693:30	###but , you know , it 's just that we have *-1 to play every game away , you know , E_S ###it 's going *-1 to be tough , E_S ###\[ but , \+ but \] every- , N_S ###the competition \[ is , \+ are \] teams that they 've already beat *T*-1 this year , E_S ###so , I mean , Atlanta , they 're in it , too , E_S ###and we beat them E_S ###and , uh , see , Detroit , we play them next week , E_S ###but , you know , we should beat them . E_S ###Everybody feels like we should be able *-1 to beat them E_S ###\[ so , it 's , \+ so everything 's , \] uh , looking real good . E_S 
137702:4	###\[ so , it 's , \+ so everything 's , \] uh , looking real good . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Course , I think , you know , 0 you ca n't really go by what *T*-1 happened earlier in the season because teams jell together or they 've had injuries that *T*-2 heal E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###SpeakerA43 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###\[ and , you know it can be a tot- , \+ or injuries that , uh , *T*-1 have newly happened and it could be almost a totally \] new team *ICH*-2 out there than the one 0 we played *T*-3 . E_S 
137740:6	###SpeakerA57 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###More than , N_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###They 're playing tonight in fact . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###I 'm watching them on T V right now . E_S 
137822:4	###SpeakerB10 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###It 's kind of their , N_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###I was wondering where that came from *T*-1 E_S ###because they 're talking like it was an American built car . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . 
137860:22	###SpeakerB24 . ###It really is *?* . E_S ###It 's got pretty good acceleration , too . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###It 's got a C D player in it , E_S ###so \[ I can , \+ I can \] play those E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerA27 . 
137931:4	###SpeakerB56 . ###If it does , people go , what 's this stuff *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Yeah , E_S ###uh , originally I 'm from West Virginia . E_S ###We got a pretty fair amount of snow . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Oh , E_S ###well , you had some there . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . 
138039:8	###but \[ the , \+ this \] Lexus is nothing like 0 I have ever been in *T*-1 before . E_S ###It 's just , N_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###Like * sitting in your living room . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it really is *?* , E_S ###and it 's got a lumbar support in the seats . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###Adjustable ? E_S 
138040:23	###It 's just , N_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###Like * sitting in your living room . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it really is *?* , E_S ###and it 's got a lumbar support in the seats . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###Adjustable ? E_S ###SpeakerB102 . 
138061:16	###but , uh , I think 0 \[ they 're , \+ big city public schools by definition are \] having \[ a , \+ a \] tough time right now \[ just from , \+ uh , probably from \] budget cuts \[ and , \+ and \] everything else going on . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh , why did you choose a private school *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Well , I had one that *T*-1 was needed *-2 to be able *-3 to be moved *-4 along \[ at a , \+ at a \] pace a little faster than he was going *-5 to be able *-6 to be moved *-7 in public school , E_S ###so \[ he 's , \+ he \] has been going to private since kindergarten . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Public school . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###SpeakerA7 . 
138090:14	###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh , overall on campus about twelve hundred , but in the \[ upper school , \+ upper four grades , \] uh , about four hundred and something E_S ###so it 's maybe a hundred per grade . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###A hundred per grade , that 's a good size . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it really is *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###* Kind of gives them the , you know , N_S 
138198:11	###so I mean , obviously , kids are not the same *ICH*-1 now as they used *-2 to be *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###I mean they 're exposed *-1 to a whole lot more things . E_S ###They have a whole lot more , uh , variety of things \[ \[ they \+ they 're , \] \+ that they \] see and do *T*-1 at an earlier age , E_S ###so life is not maybe as simple as it was *?* at one time , E_S ###\[ but , \+ but \] still , I think 0 it goes back to a commitment by the parents *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] teach , uh , basic values and basic , uh , respectful \[ of , \+ uh , -ness \] of authority . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Right . E_S 
138205:6	###\[ but , \+ but \] still , I think 0 it goes back to a commitment by the parents *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] teach , uh , basic values and basic , uh , respectful \[ of , \+ uh , -ness \] of authority .

E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###And I just do n't think that this does n't always get emphasized *-1 anymore , uh , E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###That just is n't coming through is it *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###SpeakerA69 . ###SpeakerB70 . 
138257:41	###or , N_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###No , E_S ###they do not do uniforms , although one , where he was *T*-1 between like second and eighth grade did . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###SpeakerA89 . ###Yeah , E_S ###there are quite a few of your s- , N_S 
138270:19	###SpeakerB2 . ###What kind of woodworking do you do *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Do you , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###SpeakerA5 . ###Well , \[ k- , \+ kind \] of , mainly the woodworking 0 I 've done *T*-1 lately is , uh , * made like , uh , for example a little nativity scene . ###Uh , not \[ the , \+ uh , the \] whole figurines and so forth , but mainly the stable , ###* put some shelves in ###\[ and , \+ and \] some odd stuff around the house E_S 
138379:8	###SpeakerA45 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Uh , it \[ t- , \+ seems to \] me 0 the radial arm saw \[ is , \+ is \] better , E_S ###well , \[ it , \+ it \] takes up less room . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###I mean , \[ you , \+ you \] set the wood down E_S ###and you move the saw . E_S 
138437:35	###It 's an opportunity * to get out and relieve some of the pressure that you feel *T*-1 day to day E_S ###and it 's a great \[ stress , \+ stress \] reliever .

138490:35	###SpeakerB16 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###And , N_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###How was it *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Well , I think 0 \[ they had a , \+ they had \] two teachers E_S ###and I think 0 there were twenty kids , E_S 
138659:52	###Is that what \[ you 're , \+ you 're \] thinking 0 the subject is about *T*-2 ? E_S ###SpeakerA6 . ###What would we like *-2 to say *T*-1 . E_S ###I think , N_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###SpeakerA8 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB9 . ###SpeakerA10 . ###I think 0 that 's what the subject is about *T*-1 . E_S 
138660:48	###SpeakerA6 . ###What would we like *-2 to say *T*-1 . E_S ###I think , N_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###SpeakerA8 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB9 . ###SpeakerA10 . ###I think 0 that 's what the subject is about *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB11 . 
138669:27	###SpeakerB11 . ###Did you read , uh , the article in the paper today about this particular subject ? E_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###In \[ the Dallas , \+ the MORNING TIMES ? \] E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###I guess 0 I did not . E_S ###SpeakerB15 . ###Uh , the state of Washington and the state of Minnesota is , uh , going *-1 to begin *-2 testing \[ a program , \+ a state funded program \] for citizens of those two states E_S 
138679:33	###and there 's fourteen other , uh , states that *T*-1 are considering it . Least according to the article in the paper this morning . E_S ###I think 0 it 's a trend \[ \[ that *T*-3 's , \+ that *T*-4 's , \] \+ that *T*-1 's , \] uh , probably may go nationwide eventually because I think 0 national health is something that we all need *T*-2 . E_S ###It 's getting to a point that you have *-1 to have it *T*-2 , E_S ###you have *-1 to have some form of health insurance . E_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###Well , it *EXP*-1 's been interesting that we , N_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###Extremely expensive , though . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###Yes . E_S 
138681:121	###It 's getting to a point that you have *-1 to have it *T*-2 , E_S ###you have *-1 to have some form of health insurance .

138690:88	###SpeakerB19 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###And yet , I do n't think 0 we 've ever quite decided who *T*-1 's really supposed *-2 to pay for it . E_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###Well , that 's the thing , you know , E_S ###uh , unfortunately the ones that *T*-1 currently pay and pay the premiums for health insurance \[ are , \+ are \] paying for the people that *T*-2 do n't have health insurance . E_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###Which *T*-1 is why people are talking about *T*-2 , N_S ###we ought *-1 to just admit it perhaps and then try and somehow subsidize it in a way that *T*-2 's more fair . E_S 
138732:13	###SpeakerB37 . ###No , E_S ###it 's not free , E_S ###but , uh , \[ It 's , \+ it 's \] a situation that because I did n't have any insurance and I was on unemployment , it was paid *-1 by the county *T*-2 .

138808:23	###Thirty-one percent of all Texas children do not have insurance and are not on Medicaid . E_S ###SpeakerB67 . ###* Did not know that .

E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###So , she did n't learn a lot , E_S ###but \[ it , \+ I think 0 it \] calmed her down a little bit , E_S ###and she 's used *-1 to being around other dogs now . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###How long did it take *T*-1 ? E_S 
141018:26	###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###Donna , um , you said 0 you have three children . E_S ###What , uh , kinds of activities do you spend *T*-1 with them ? E_S ###Is it MUMBLEx ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Okay , E_S ###um , we have an eleven year old , an eight year old , and a three year old E_S ###and , um , uh , my husband , * let 's see , he coaches basketball with Brian , 
141040:8	###SpeakerA7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###We take turns with her . E_S ###Um , uh , * let 's see , E_S ###we have a computer E_S ###and we do a lot of things with the kids on the computer . E_S ###Um , uh , * let 's what else we do *T*-1 . E_S ###Oh , plus we watch a little T V together . E_S ###We really do n't watch , I think 0 *T*-1 , as much T V as a lot of people . E_S 
141068:28	###SpeakerA15 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###he gets home from work late or whatever E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] \[ usually , \+ once in a while \] he 'll read the story to little one , E_S ###but that 's basically my job . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Um , E_S 
141282:13	###SpeakerB13 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###Most everybody is right in that area . E_S ###SpeakerB15 . ###That makes it a lot easier . E_S A lot more convenient . E_S ###That is why we only do it once every five or ten years *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . 
141286:6	###SpeakerB15 . ###That makes it a lot easier . E_S A lot more convenient . E_S ###That is why we only do it once every five or ten years *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###Spec- , N_S ###because it *EXP*-1 is always that hard * to get everyone together . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###Yeah . E_S 
141330:13	###and some put up the volleyball net and sit around and tell stories and catch up and play volleyball all day and get really fat . E_S ###SpeakerB31 . ###* Eat a lot . E_S ###SpeakerA32 . ###Oh , gosh . E_S ###SpeakerB33 . ###It is a lot harder for us because \[ we are \+ like I said we are \] spread out E_S ###SpeakerA34 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB35 . 
141375:57	###SpeakerB49 . ###You ca n't really get away . E_S ###SpeakerA50 . ###Usually not . E_S ###We managed *-1 to get to one . E_S ###That was before I started school E_S ###and she took that summer off . E_S ###But , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB51 . ###Well , now that we have been talking about it , \[ I , \+ uh , I \] am kind of getting home sick now . E_S 
141392:26	###SpeakerA56 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB57 . ###And see , my grandmother is the one that *T*-1 use *-2 to plan this stuff basically . E_S ###SpeakerA58 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB59 . ###So , unless the aunts and uncles really get on the ball and put stuff together , it is kind of like . E_S ###She was like the glue , E_S ###so . N_S 
141396:13	###SpeakerA58 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB59 . ###So , unless the aunts and uncles really get on the ball and put stuff together , it is kind of like . E_S ###She was like the glue , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerA60 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I understand . E_S ###Where is home *T*-1 for you ? E_S 
141449:4	###and , somebody brings the volleyball net , E_S ###somebody brings a whole lot of ice for the watermelon E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB75 . ###Well , uh , uh , I guess 0 probably the last one 0 I went to *T*-1 I met so many people that I had not seen *T*-2 in probably \[ ten , \+ over ten \] years . E_S ###It was like , do n't you remember me . E_S ###And I am like no . E_S ###SpeakerA76 . ###Am I related to you ? E_S ###SpeakerB77 . 
141450:8	###somebody brings a whole lot of ice for the watermelon E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB75 . ###Well , uh , uh , I guess 0 probably the last one 0 I went to *T*-1 I met so many people that I had not seen *T*-2 in probably \[ ten , \+ over ten \] years .

141559:15	###She is in the seventh grade . E_S ###So , we have got , still , all sorts of good activities since , N_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###Oh yeah . E_S ###You kind of got , uh , a span there , ###huh ? E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###SpeakerB29 . ###Oh , well what do you do *T*-1 with your seventh grader ? E_S ###SpeakerA30 . 
141607:8	###and \[ I , \+ I \] taught school for six years . E_S ###SpeakerA40 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerB41 . ###So , I do know about that program E_S ###and N_S ###SpeakerA42 . ###Well , my wife is involved E_S ###and she kind of heads that up for these kids , E_S ###and last year \[ they , \+ they , \] got , uh , the state level . E_S 
141615:11	###and she kind of heads that up for these kids , E_S ###and last year \[ they , \+ they , \] got , uh , the state level . E_S ###They did not win that , E_S ###but they , uh , got one local and , uh , one region , E_S ###and they got a new mix of kids this time . E_S ###So , it keeps them busy . E_S ###SpeakerB43 . ###Oh , uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA44 . ###It keeps them busy . E_S 
141638:4	###But , uh , so . N_S ###SpeakerB49 . ###Oh . Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA50 . ###\[ They , \+ uh , she \] enjoys that kind of stuff and , uh , does well with it . E_S ###SpeakerB51 . ###Oh , how neat . E_S ###SpeakerA52 . ###So yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB53 . 
141638:19	###But , uh , so . N_S ###SpeakerB49 . ###Oh . Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA50 . ###\[ They , \+ uh , she \] enjoys that kind of stuff and , uh , does well with it . E_S ###SpeakerB51 . ###Oh , how neat . E_S ###SpeakerA52 . ###So yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB53 . 
141685:14	###but N_S ###SpeakerA68 . ###* Got *-1 to wait a couple years . E_S ###SpeakerB69 . ###Yeah , E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA70 . ###Sledding , that is what you have got *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S ###Tobogganing . E_S ###SpeakerB71 . 
141747:20	###SpeakerA88 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB89 . ###You know , I get ready , that , N_S come about this time of year I am kind of ready for it to start *-1 getting spring , E_S ###and , it is too early yet . E_S ###SpeakerA90 . ###Well , \[ you have got , \+ You have got \] five months before you will see that . E_S ###SpeakerB91 . ###SpeakerA92 . ###SpeakerB93 . 
141796:6	###And so I often drop in on a break \[ and \+ and \] read it . E_S ###SpeakerB9 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA10 . ###And I keep the radio on quite a bit when I 'm home *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###And then \[ I , \+ I \] figure 0 if there 's \[ big , \+ big \] news , I 'll hear it from my husband *ICH*-2 when he gets home *T*-1 or , someone else , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB13 . 
142122:25	###SpeakerB30 . ###Right . E_S ###Well , the reason why we play over there *T*-1 is because it 's where , since we are a Garland resident , they gave us a special deal where you can get , uh , ten rounds of golf for a hundred dollars *T*-2 , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###a hundred dollars E_S ###cause it is half price what the normal green fees are *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###So that is why we you know play over there *T*-1 E_S 
142167:45	###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###But I N_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Oh well that sounds like fun too . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###but my golf clubs will probably rust before I get *-1 to use them again E_S ###because my boys are still right at the beginning age E_S ###and it is probably going *-1 to be six to eight years before they go to college . E_S 
142382:30	###SpeakerA40 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Do you have electricity out there . E_S ###SpeakerB41 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA42 . ###Yeah . E_S ###You 've got a phone obviously . E_S ###SpeakerB43 . ###Well , actually as a matter of fact , they just ran the phone three years ago . E_S 
142482:6	###She takes her , uh , motor home . E_S ###You know , she 's got one of these huge Winnebago 's with a refrigerator and air-conditioning , color T V , microwave oven you know . E_S ###SpeakerA80 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB81 . ###She just , N_S ###* roughing it for me is * going to the Holiday Inn and getting a shower . You know . E_S ###SpeakerA82 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB83 . 
142624:6	###SpeakerA37 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###I think 0 I am going *-1 to put something like a brown on it , on the outside . And maybe , a little deeper brown *ICH*-2 in the entry way or something so it will stand out a little . ###SpeakerA39 . ###Oh , that will be nice . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###SpeakerA41 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . 
142976:38	###and I 'm sure , N_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###You do , huh ? E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Well , E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###That 's contrary to , uh , popular belief , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Oh , I know , E_S ###I know so , E_S 
143208:63	###SpeakerA89 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###You know , we 're so fast paced here , E_S ###and over there , you know , every time 0 we 'd go \[ and , \+ and \] eat dinner or lunch or whatever *T*-1 we 'd always have *-2 to ask for the check you know E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###SpeakerA93 . ###Yeah . E_S 
143382:23	###SpeakerA17 . ###\[ R- , \+ right . \] E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###so \[ we , \+ uh , we \] look at the paper , E_S ###we \[ look at our , \+ talk to our \] realtor E_S ###and you can cut , you know , the listings , uh , in about a third when you go from three to four bedrooms *ICH*-1 *T*-2 you know , or five . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Are you looking E_S 
143630:21	###SpeakerB22 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###You may be familiar with cooperative learning . E_S ###Have you ever , N_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Well \[ you can , \+ you can \] tell me a little bit more about it because I do n't think 0 we did that in Utah . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Well , the cooperative learning is a technique that *T*-1 was tried *-2 initially * to integrate the public schools . E_S ###And , uh , \[ what , \+ what \] it involves *T*-1 , basically , is the use of peer groups E_S 
143639:13	###And , uh , \[ what , \+ what \] it involves *T*-1 , basically , is the use of peer groups E_S ###and the , uh , teacher becomes \[ a , \+ uh , a \] sort of a \[ consultant , \+ resource person \] \[ to the cooperative learning , \+ uh , to the learning cooperatives , \] I guess 0 they 're called *-1 *RNR*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###And there are , uh , some fairly sophisticated approaches that *T*-1 are used *-2 in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people , uh , gain a competence with respect to the material . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh , I think that the combination of , uh , technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution in the way 0 we learn *T*-1 . E_S 
143641:15	###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###And there are , uh , some fairly sophisticated approaches that *T*-1 are used *-2 in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people , uh , gain a competence with respect to the material .

E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh , I think that the combination of , uh , technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution in the way 0 we learn *T*-1 . E_S ###Uh , I think 0 there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system , uh , that *T*-1 will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster . E_S ###Uh , school systems are , in too many states , dominated *-1 by administrators E_S 
143657:9	###and , uh , I think 0 certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research , uh , uh , of the sort that people like me do *T*-3 * looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used *-1 *-1 to improve performance , particularly , uh , accelerate \[ the , \+ the \] pace of learning *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###And , my feeling is that , uh , those kinds of things will solve the problem eventually . E_S ###I do n't know what form it will ultimately take *T*-1 . E_S ###Uh , uh , but , I think that the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we 're paying an enormous price for , uh , inferior quality when the people involved really are n't inferior *T*-1 , E_S ###so it must be the way 0 we 're managing the process *T*-1 that , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Yeah , E_S 
143662:10	###I do n't know what form it will ultimately take *T*-1 . E_S ###Uh , uh , but , I think that the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we 're paying an enormous price for , uh , inferior quality when the people involved really are n't inferior *T*-1 , E_S ###so it must be the way 0 we 're managing the process *T*-1 that , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I see what year saying *T*-1 , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###I totally agree . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###\[ \[ I , \+ I \] do n't , \+ I do n't \] think 0 \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a matter \[ of , \+ of , \] uh , talented people 0 *T*-1 to do it , \[ a- , \+ both as , \] quote , unquote students and as teachers , E_S 
143664:30	###so it must be the way 0 we 're managing the process *T*-1 that , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I see what year saying *T*-1 , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###I totally agree .

143673:28	###SpeakerB36 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###you must see kids with real significant problems , uh , in some cases . E_S ###Uh , course , I always see the , N_S ###I do n't know \[ how hard , \+ how hard \] is it *T*-1 , uh , in the public school system in Iowa City ? E_S ###\[ Is it , \+ is it , \] uh , deteriorated a lot . E_S 
143862:27	###but you know , N_S ###SpeakerB59 . ###Is that the one from Sears ? E_S ###SpeakerA60 . ###Uh , I think 0 Sears originally put it out , E_S ###SpeakerB61 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA62 . ###but \[ it 's , \+ uh , it 's \] pretty well taken all over the U S now . E_S ###I mean , uh , I 've have n't found many places that *T*-1 do n't take Discover . E_S 
143896:20	###but , I 'm not sure . E_S ###SpeakerB73 . ###Um . Well , you know , Sears was one of the few department stores that *T*-1 never would take any other credit cards . E_S ###SpeakerA74 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB75 . ###I worked \[ w- , \+ \] at Sears for over ten years E_S ###and , uh , it was only a Sears card that they would take *T*-1 until I guess 0 they decided *-2 to join the club and come up with \[ their own credit card , \+ another credit card \] that *T*-3 was accepted *-4 , E_S ###SpeakerA76 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
143989:24	###SpeakerA4 . ###I do , too . E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###Mandatory , I mean , summary execution , on the steps , that day . E_S ###SpeakerA6 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###well , I think 0 , you know , \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] in that same , E_S ###I think 0 \[ \[ if it 's , \+ uh , if it 's a con- , \] \+ if it 's a convicted , \] uh , felon on parole uh , and he goes out \[ and , \+ and \] commits another crime or kills somebody , \[ \[ I , \+ you know , I , \] \+ I \] feel the same way , E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
144004:42	###SpeakerA10 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###But , I do know that \[ some people , \+ almost all people \] usually die before that point . E_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###They just get too old . E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
144073:48	###I think 0 the guy should have ninety days E_S ###and if he ca n't produce evidence not argument , but evidence , N_S ###SpeakerA40 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB41 . ###SpeakerA42 . ###See , the only thing 0 \[ I do n't , \+ you know , I do n't \] understand *T*-1 , I guess 0 \[ I , \+ I \] do n't understand our judicial system , uh , as it is right now E_S ###because \[ I , \+ you know , if \] somebody has been convicted *-1 and has been sentenced *-1 *-1 to be put *-2 to death , how is it that they can appeal and appeal and appeal and get stays of \[ ex- , \+ execution *T*-3 ? \] E_S ###I mean , how , you know , ###is there , N_S 
144139:31	###SpeakerA66 . ###SpeakerB67 . ###They all look the same to me , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA68 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB69 . ###Big lips , flat nose , ###yep , ###that was him . E_S ###SpeakerA70 . 
144216:6	###that was a good move for the Warriors * to trade for him .

144943:66	###SpeakerA7 . ###You bet . E_S ###You know , where I 've noticed it more *T*-1 , I think 0 *T*-2 , is , N_S ###I 'm a traveling salesperson E_S ###and I have traveled most of my life E_S ###and I know 0 just especially in the last , oh , ten years and really since , N_S in the last half of dozen years I see more and more women traveling . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###You know , as far as * boarding planes and driving cars and calling on customers . E_S 
144978:74	###\[ and they 're , \+ and they 're \] doing the same , uh , or carrying the same job responsibility E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Right .

E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###SpeakerB20 . 
145166:123	###SpeakerB26 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###because my wife will be doing her internship that semester . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###It will be forty hour week , \[ not , \+ no , \] eight to five type of thing . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah . E_S 
145178:23	###Right now we 're trying *-1 to avoid it , E_S ###but we just , as a matter of fact just yesterday hired \[ a , \+ a \] girl *-1 to , uh , watch him .

145644:52	###SpeakerB9 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA10 . ###And then they just sort of do like a little program or , you know , something like that so that everyone 's sort of involved *-1 .

146696:35	###SpeakerA20 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###SpeakerA22 . ###I think so , E_S ###just because they have *-1 to *?* . You know , E_S ###SpeakerB23 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA24 . ###SpeakerB25 . 
146727:9	###and , so , I do n't know . E_S ###I think 0 there needs *-1 to be more places E_S ###and also I have a real strong opinion .

E_S ###SpeakerB31 . 
147180:8	###and this I think 0 *T*-1 is one of the big problems , E_S ###SpeakerA36 . ###Yeah . E_S ###In this area too since , you know , in Texas we 're so spread out , E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###we have *-1 to drive so far , E_S ###but I know 0 in Colorado I have witnessed that where \[ it just , \+ uh , it just \] stacks up \[ at the \+ when the \] Rockies starts *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S ###but we 're even getting it here .

E_S ###SpeakerB41 . ###Well that makes a lot of sense . E_S ###I mean \[ I , \+ I \] had n't thought about it that way E_S ###but \[ it , \+ it , \] N_S

147474:14	###SpeakerA7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###So , \[ I , \+ you know , you \] pick up some traits from her and stuff .

E_S 
147728:58	###SpeakerA5 . ###Right . E_S ###That 's a good point . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###But , uh , other than that I think 0 maybe it just depends on how you define honesty *T*-1 .

E_S ###I guess 0 maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who *T*-1 is very unreasonable in some way , that , uh , you , uh , would have a problem , uh , you know , that you would n't convict someone who *T*-2 maybe should be convicted *-4 . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Have you ever served on a jury before ? E_S ###SpeakerB6 . 
151065:101	###but I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it does n't work as well . E_S ###Especially sort of . N_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###I would n't think that it does I mean , \[ \[ from , \+ from \] my , \+ from what \] I experienced *T*-1 in them , E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###\[ How , \+ wha- , \] N_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###\[ it did n't , \+ you know , it did n't \] turn out the way 0 I planned it *T*-1 , I mean , the way that I would think that it would go *T*-2 .

151065:146	###but I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it does n't work as well . E_S ###Especially sort of .

151227:31	###SpeakerA25 . ###No . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###they want *-1 to get the best , uh , mix for their case , E_S ###so they ask all kinds of wild questions . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###\[ That \+ that 's \] a science in itself . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . 
151342:44	###and we had *-1 to acquit him in both cases . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Uh , it was too circumstantial ? E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Uh , yeah , E_S ###it was *?* , yeah , in some of the critical things , like \[ the off- , \+ special investigations , \] at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person , E_S ###but something happened to the camera and the tape and N_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . 
151453:20	###SpeakerA34 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB35 . ###SpeakerA36 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###But if they catch you , if you test positive for \[ a , \+ a \] controlled substance , then you get fired *-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###Oh , wow . E_S ###SpeakerB39 . 
151467:16	###all right , it 's probably the same thing . E_S ###I 'm not really sure what the , N_S ###SpeakerB41 . ###Yeah , E_S ###really , E_S ###it 's one of those things that you read *T*-1 once , E_S ###and then , \[ if you , \+ if you 're \] not worried about it , you just forget about it . E_S ###SpeakerA42 . ###That 's right . E_S ###But I know , 0 they do have counseling , and that they do give you a second chance , E_S 
151517:23	###That 'd be just as dangerous . E_S ###SpeakerB59 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well , especially around , uh , you know , equipment , machinery and stuff . E_S ###SpeakerA60 . ###Huh . That 's true . E_S ###SpeakerB61 . ###You know , \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] gone out and \[ had a , \+ had a \] beer at lunch time , but not to excess in any case . E_S ###SpeakerA62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
151566:119	###SpeakerA6 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###There 's too many cases where it can , you know , N_S ###there can be false positive results , and \[ that , \+ that \] sort of thing . E_S ###I do n't think 0 there 's any definitive , you know , N_S okay this person is taking drugs , E_S ###so we do n't want him here . E_S ###SpeakerA8 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB9 . 
151607:51	###SpeakerA20 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I had it during a job interview , E_S ###and I just thought 0 it *ICH*-4 was dumb of the company , at a point where they were trying *-1 to convince me \[ to , \+ to \] want *-2 to work for them *T*-3 * to do this , E_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###and I 'm just like , well , uh , I 'm not even going *-1 to think much about it if you 're going *-2 to treat me with this much respect even before you 've gotten *-3 to know me . E_S ###SpeakerB23 . ###Yeah . E_S 
151665:11	###SpeakerA40 . ###Well , do you think 0 it *EXP*-1 's , should be illegal for an employer to do this E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerB41 . ###Uh , I really think 0 it should be *?* , except as I 've mentioned twice now , in the specified industries \[ or , \+ or \] jobs , because there are certain things where it *EXP*-1 's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA42 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB43 . ###And other than that \[ I think , \+ I do not think \] 0 it should be allowable . E_S ###I think 0 it *EXP*-2 should be illegal for them \[ to , \+ to \] want *-1 to do that . E_S 
151670:136	###SpeakerA42 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB43 . ###And other than that \[ I think , \+ I do not think \] 0 it should be allowable . E_S ###I think 0 it *EXP*-2 should be illegal for them \[ to , \+ to \] want *-1 to do that . E_S ###\[ It should , \+ it 's \] kind of the big brother syndrome , E_S ###I mean , I just , N_S ###anything like that just kind of scares me . E_S ###SpeakerA44 . ###I tend *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] view it , N_S 
151836:36	###And so that was a real challenge , E_S ###and I was president of our family reunion for two years , E_S ###and I was n't very MUMBLEx at that duty , for two years in a row , E_S ###but I found that advance planning was the key to success . E_S ###SpeakerB55 . ###Uh , also one thing that *T*-1 's helpful , E_S ###and I do n't know if your family 's spread out or whatever E_S ###SpeakerA56 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB57 . 
151847:29	###so , N_S ###SpeakerA58 . ###Oh , that 's wonderful , though . N_S ###SpeakerB59 . ###But it 's just kind of like * get on the telephone E_S ###and , it 's so and such days from such and such date E_S ###SpeakerA60 . ###SpeakerB61 . ###SpeakerA62 . ###Oh . E_S 
151863:6	###SpeakerB65 . ###I would say 0 you 're spread out , then . E_S ###SpeakerA66 . ###We are *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB67 . ###Uh , my immediate family , you know , \[ my , \+ my \] parents and my brothers and sisters , I guess 0 we 're the ones that *T*-1 have the gypsy blood or whatever , E_S ###because my dad was in the Army E_S ###and \[ we 're \+ we 're \] pretty strung out all over . E_S ###SpeakerA68 . ###Oh . E_S 
151863:51	###SpeakerB65 . ###I would say 0 you 're spread out , then . E_S ###SpeakerA66 . ###We are *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB67 . ###Uh , my immediate family , you know , \[ my , \+ my \] parents and my brothers and sisters , I guess 0 we 're the ones that *T*-1 have the gypsy blood or whatever , E_S ###because my dad was in the Army E_S ###and \[ we 're \+ we 're \] pretty strung out all over . E_S ###SpeakerA68 . ###Oh . E_S 
151907:13	###Good-bye . E_S ###SpeakerA84 . ###Oh , you 're ready *-1 to move on to bi- , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , E_S ###you want *-1 to start ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I might as well *?* . E_S ###Uh , one of the things 0 I 'm very concerned about the air pollution *T*-1 , is \[ \[ \[ the , \+ uh , this , \] \+ this , \] \+ the \] ozone layer , uh , uh , issue . E_S 
151990:25	###SpeakerB30 . ###Well , \[ \[ most , \+ most , \] \+ most \] of the time when you see \[ bus , \+ uh , you know , the busses \] with the diesel *T*-1 \[ that 's , \+ uh , those \] are carbon particles , and carbon dioxide and water vapor , uh , E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###because \[ when you , \+ when diesel \] is burned *-1 *T*-2 it 's it , N_S ###you know diesel fuel is burned *-1 \[ in a , \+ in the \] diesel engine E_S ###it 's burned *-1 so completely , that you do n't have any , uh , nitrous oxides , uh , or oxides of nitrogen , uh , 0 * to , uh , form *T*-4 \[ because of , \+ by virtue of \] the very combustion process of the diesel engine , because diesel oil \[ is , \+ uh , is \] not very volatile . You know , where gasoline , if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it 's gone *-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Oh . E_S 
152010:23	###but it 's slow burning \[ at , \+ at , \] uh , normal pressures . E_S ###That 's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios *T*-2 \[ as the , \+ as the \] air is heated *-1 , you know , by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Oh , I see . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###SpeakerA41 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
152022:15	###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay , Bill , E_S ###right ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Okay , Bill , E_S ###have you done much camping ? E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh , yes . E_S 
152188:17	###SpeakerA65 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###SpeakerA67 . ###Uh , they 're covered *-1 like with a heavy armor type stuff , E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . 
152354:16	###SpeakerB48 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###but I 'll tell you , 0 \[ I , \+ I \] do n't mind *-1 having dental , you know , E_S ###sometimes dental costs can be , um , just about as expensive , if not more , E_S ###and I know 0 historically a lot of companies I think carried dental as a rider along with the medical E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###but I 'm not sure 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] widely followed *-1 any more . E_S 
152387:8	###SpeakerA59 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###SpeakerA61 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###but the main , N_S ###I think 0 \[ the , \+ the \] health and all that and the dental *ICH*-1 is the same for everybody , and the retirement plan . E_S ###But the main difference is in \[ the , \+ uh , the \] way 0 sick time is accrued *-1 and vacation time is accrued *-2 *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . 
152396:10	###SpeakerA63 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###SpeakerA65 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Uh , for the operating staff it 's \[ on a seniority , \+ it 's , you know , based *-1 on how long they 've worked there *T*-2 . \] E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . 
152453:45	###SpeakerB10 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###SpeakerB12 . ###Are they like pretty much train *-1 for a specific job E_S ###and that what I hired for *T*-1 and then \[ I , \+ \] just very little variation from that . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Yeah , E_S ###somewhat that , E_S ###but then also there just is n't the ability * to in one sense have , uh , a broader scope for * rewarding people for their performances . E_S 
152560:9	###uh , \[ the , \+ there \] is not much incentive for innovativeness because the limitation for reward is very severe E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###but if you 're in the corporate world , I think there is considerable motivation for I guess \[ in- , \+ innovation , \] E_S ###although \[ he , \+ \] you know , * the more complex 0 your structure *?* *T*-2 the , uh , less difficult it *EXP*-1 is *T*-3 * to kind of carry some things through E_S ###SpeakerB54 . 
152561:57	###SpeakerB50 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###but if you 're in the corporate world , I think there is considerable motivation for I guess \[ in- , \+ innovation , \] E_S ###although \[ he , \+ \] you know , * the more complex 0 your structure *?* *T*-2 the , uh , less difficult it *EXP*-1 is *T*-3 * to kind of carry some things through E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
152682:23	###SpeakerB36 . ###This is very true . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###\[ I , \+ uh , I \] think 0 there is more of an ability \[ of \+ you know , you know for \] * selecting \[ a jury , \+ two different juries \] that *T*-1 would most of the time come up with \[ the same idea , \+ uh , the same idea \] versus you know whether he is guilty or innocent E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . 
152754:68	###SpeakerA69 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###but , uh , his attorneys gotten him off . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Uh , the city has dropped their charges against him because \[ their , \+ the \] attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt * to convince the judge . E_S ###So I do n't know . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . 
152769:96	###Uh , what 's your feeling about that *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###I agree . E_S ###I think 0 taxes are high . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Right , E_S ###uh , where you live *T*-1 do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both ? E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Oh , yes . E_S ###Uh-huh . E_S 
152848:16	###and when you send it to Washington or send it to your state capitol *T*-1 , uh , a lot of it stays there ###and not that much comes back to you . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Right , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###I do n't know . E_S ###I , N_S ###* do n't seem like they are doing much with it , E_S 
152941:44	###SpeakerB58 . ###Um , no E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Twenty percent ? E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] have no idea , E_S ###I just . N_S ###My dad does it all for me . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###\[ Just , \+ you just \] pay it , huh . E_S 
152949:6	###SpeakerA61 . ###\[ Just , \+ you just \] pay it , huh . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###I use , N_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###\[ You 're like , \+ you 're like \] my daughter who *T*-1 is in college down in Massachusetts E_S ###and , uh , she works as a waitress E_S ###and she is attending college full time also E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
152996:6	###The stations 0 I listen to *T*-1 are just mainly music . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 you pretty much have *-1 to listen to all news station * to get any news at all . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Do you think that T V is , uh , pretty accurate . E_S ###I mean sometimes do you think 0 it gets pretty commercialized E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerB14 . 
153003:18	###I mean sometimes do you think 0 it gets pretty commercialized E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Well , what I really do n't like *T*-1 about T V , especially local news as compared to like national news is just , uh , 0 \[ it seems , \+ it seems \] like everything is very spoon feed E_S ###and you know \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] more like the news shows \[ is now \+ is now \] you know an entertainment show like a sitcom or like the news , because they would always have like the wonderful investigative reports , you know , is your kid 's bus driver smoking crack , on the way to school , you know ? E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###SpeakerA17 . ###SpeakerB18 .

E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###SpeakerA17 . ###SpeakerB18 . ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's N_S ###they mainly go with like popular topics just not like basic news . E_S 
153007:114	###and you know \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] more like the news shows \[ is now \+ is now \] you know an entertainment show like a sitcom or like the news , because they would always have like the wonderful investigative reports , you know , is your kid 's bus driver smoking crack , on the way to school , you know ?

153043:38	###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Yeah , E_S ###the farm report . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Yeah , E_S ###farm report and oil reports . E_S 
153162:42	###SpeakerA1 . ###-kay , Dave . E_S ###What kind of pets do you have *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Oh , we have one rotten cat . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###One rotten cat . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's my son 's cat . E_S 
153183:21	###SpeakerA9 . ###Oh yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Yeah E_S ###he 's , uh , a one owner . E_S ###He likes one boy in the family ###and that 's about it . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###That 's odd . E_S ###How does he treat the other people *T*-1 ? E_S 
153202:10	###SpeakerA15 . ###Did he raise him or something ? E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###\[ \[ He 's , \+ he , \] \+ we \] bought the cat for him E_S ###and so he 's , uh , been the one that you know *T*-1 spent the most time with him .

153243:21	###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###so that 's mostly why we got it *T*-1 . *-2 To keep her company while I am away at work .

153472:19	###SpeakerA39 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###but . Do you own a gun ? E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###No . E_S ###I 've thought about *-1 getting one . E_S ###If I get one , I think 0 I will probably , you know , get something . E_S ###I probably would n't get a hand gun . E_S ###I would probably get like a shotgun . E_S 
153492:12	###SpeakerB46 . ###That 's true . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Uh , and you know , you , N_S ###yeah , E_S ###I just do n't understand these people , you know , like when \[ they , \+ they \] decide 0 they 're going *-1 to buy a gun 0 *T*-2 to protect themselves *T*-3 . E_S ###They go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which *T*-1 is going *-2 to shoot through you know , N_S ###they are probably going *-1 to miss the person E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] they 're going *-1 to shoot through five wall , and hit someone , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . 
153514:11	###a wall will stop it pretty much . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###and , uh , my Dad gave me a gun E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###but I never did go out and practice with it enough * to feel comfortable with it E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . 
153541:21	###SpeakerB66 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###SpeakerB68 . ###And they get it from you . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###And you know , you 're pretty much dead you know . Because \[ you , \+ you 've \] just told the person that \[ you , \+ you 're \] about *-1 to kill them then , You know E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . 
153652:16	###SpeakerA21 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###And I guess 0 that 's a way of budgeting . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah . E_S ###That 's , N_S ###I guess 0 I kind of do a similar thing . More , uh , medium or longer range . E_S ###I just have a maybe a targeted amount that I will save for *T*-1 . E_S ###Like I am , N_S 
153677:6	###and I like *-1 to drive pick up truck . E_S ###So , we are on a schedule where I try every , uh , three or four years *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] buy a new one *T*-2 . E_S ###And you know I am constantly making car payments , E_S ###but I figure 0 that 's got *-1 to be the story of my life anyway , is * making car payments . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###So , uh , you know , I get one paid for * E_S ###and , uh , actually I am saving up for another one besides E_S ###so \[ it 's \+ you know , it 's \] kind of a never ending thing , E_S 
153707:6	###and I use mine just *-2 to go back and forth to work which *T*-1 is only ten miles away E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###so . N_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###But if you are rolling it over every three years , it *EXP*-1 might be advantageous * to do that . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . ###SpeakerB46 . 
153790:9	###SpeakerB14 . ###Yeah . E_S ###It is *?* , E_S ###but \[ I 'm not really from \+ I 'm not really from \] Texas , E_S ###I just live down here now .

154252:26	###and so we have four checks , E_S ###but that works out nice because we get paid *-1 every week E_S ###and so that does help , E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . ###that helps a lot . E_S ###And then , uh , we do n't have a lot \[ ex- , \+ extra \] for extra spending , E_S 
154312:32	###SpeakerB42 . ###Yeah E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###\[ and \+ and \] I am sure 0 you felt \[ the \+ the \] same frustration before you got on a budget , E_S ###but you 're wondering \[ my , \+ \] when you put down all the money that you do bring *T*-1 in *T*-2 N_S ###and then you 're saying , my word where did all that money go *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###That 's a lot of money , E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerA45 . 
154787:73	###SpeakerA25 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###and , uh , I think 0 they are even putting it in the roadways these days E_S ###and they 're making clothes *ICH*-1 now that *T*-2 are recycled . E_S ###Like the recycled plastic coke bottles \[ and \+ and \] milk cartons and things like that . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###And there was a paper presented * at this conference from a guy from Alabama E_S ###and he was kind of hired *-1 to do a study by two departments for the government . E_S ###One was like , environmental protection E_S 
154874:14	###and \[ I \+ I \] do exercise on a regular basis . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###You do ? E_S ###What type of exercise do you do *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Well , I do , uh , jazzercise which *T*-1 is an aerobic , uh , program that , N_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Oh you do . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###are you familiar with it ? E_S 
154971:10	###SpeakerB44 . ###Well , now who do you play with *T*-1 ? E_S ###Do you have friends that *T*-1 play with you E_S ###or just , N_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###No , E_S ###I just shoot around by myself . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . 
155154:8	###They make me drive it like a mile down the road and spit it out down there . E_S ###What are they doing *T*-1 up there ? E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Well , here in Saskatoon , uh , much the same thing . E_S ###There is no curb pick up of , uh , any of the recycled products . E_S ###Uh , we 're in a community of about one hundred and eighty thousand people . E_S ###Uh , there are areas where we could , uh , N_S ###actually we have a couple of the , uh , handicapped societies , types of places where the uh , ###one 0 they do *T*-1 as just a recycling operation and then others 0 they collect the paper and ship it to other retailers *T*-2 E_S ###so , uh , we are able *-1 to , uh , have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing E_S 
155199:31	###actually , the government has placed the deposit which *T*-1 is the inducement * to \[ re- , \+ recycle \] the bottle so that you get your money back E_S ###and then the recycler run * by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit E_S ###\[ and then I , \+ and then they \] in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that *T*-1 do the canning of the pop and the beer \[ as \+ as \] well . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###That 's very cool . E_S ###You know \[ there 's a , \+ I heard about a \] similar program in New York City where , uh , a thing called * like Homeless Incorporated or something like that , N_S ###but what they do *T*-1 is * employ , uh , \[ homeless , \+ I think mostly men , but homeless \] people to uh , go out and collect all the recyclable cans E_S ###\[ and \+ and \] I think 0 it 's mostly cans . E_S ###There may be bottles as well , ###but like beer cans , soda cans and what not E_S 
155201:28	###\[ and then I , \+ and then they \] in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that *T*-1 do the canning of the pop and the beer \[ as \+ as \] well .

E_S ###SpeakerA17 . 
155216:8	###SpeakerB18 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###but , uh , we do n't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people *T*-1 . E_S ###We certainly have a fair number of people that *T*-1 are on \[ welfa- , \+ welfare \] and unemployment insurance and that kind of thing . E_S ###Uh , there 's psychological pressure against * employing people to do that kind of thing although , uh , scouts and hockey teams and ball teams , those kinds , uh , regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the bottles at individual homes *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Do they do it with news papers as well ? E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###They have done it some , uh , E_S 
155281:43	###SpeakerA15 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###so we are going *-1 to be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###and then the money that I will be making *T*-1 this summer we 'll be putting *T*-2 away for the college fund . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Um . * Sounds good . E_S 
155307:9	###well almost full time . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###So , it 's only recently that we 've had the money where we could start *-1 putting away large sums of it for , uh , long range goals like college and sickness and travel and that kind of thing *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###SpeakerA29 . ###That sounds good . E_S 
155390:148	###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###SpeakerB6 . ###Yeah . E_S ###That 's true . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Uh , but , uh , no E_S ###I do n't really have a budget at the moment .

155633:39	###What you 're capable of *T*-2 , ###like if you have a family 0 * to take care of *T*-3 , you know , of your own . E_S ###SpeakerB33 . ###Yeah .

155752:118	###SpeakerA78 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB79 . ###SpeakerA80 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB81 . ###SpeakerA82 . ###Oh definitely it 's , N_S ###SpeakerB83 . ###and , uh , you know , sometimes \[ it can , \+ \[ those choi- , \+ those choices \] can \] be made *-1 in advance E_S 
155797:53	###Uh , I have a thirty-seven hour work week . E_S ###How about you ? E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Well , well right now , \[ I , \+ I 'm \] just a student .

155873:8	###and he can give me access and tell me what * to do *T*-1 and just turn me *-2 loose E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah .

156132:8	###so \[ you get , \+ you get \] a lot of people out there without E T R , emission control systems on their cars and things like that .

156135:63	###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and it 's like , N_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###You get the car that *T*-1 's in the accident E_S ###and muffler falls off or something E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###and guy keeps *-1 driving along for long period of time after that . E_S

156259:97	###SpeakerB70 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Mexico City is historically been one of the worst \[ in the , \+ in the \] world for that . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###But I 've been pretty lucky , E_S ###I 've lived in cities that *T*-1 really have n't had that much of a problem , although , uh , I 'm really kind of based *-2 in Orlando , Florida E_S ###and there , you can tell that it 's getting worse . E_S 
156263:6	###SpeakerB72 . ###Yeah .

156349:8	###\[ but , \+ uh , and \] when you read a lot of this stuff *T*-1 , \[ the , \+ the \] quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so , E_S ###but uh , I mean , \[ they , \+ they \] say 0 it 's like the sixth grade reading level , E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Uh-huh .

156384:10	###SpeakerA37 . ###Well , McNeil , \[ Neil- , \+ \] and Lehrer , N_S ###I guess 0 he 's leaving , E_S ###one of them is leaving . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Uh , \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] pretty good , too . E_S ###Uh , I guess 0 a year ago you 're probably watching C N N a lot , ###right ? E_S 
156677:14	###SpeakerA3 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###And it 's eating us *-1 alive budget wise E_S ###and , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###So are they currently practicing capital punishment in your state ? E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Yes , E_S ###we do practice capital punishment , E_S 
156763:57	###SpeakerB44 . ###Well I 'm not talking about just in the school system . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###but it 's not going *-1 to , N_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###SpeakerA47 . ###Oh , I see . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###See , I 'm talking about , N_S ###like , \[ in , \+ in , \] N_S 
156805:34	###SpeakerA59 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###But that 's another subject E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Well , that 's probably true . E_S ###W- , N_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Anyway , I dealt with two or three kids *ICH*-5 today that *T*-1 are going *-2 to end up where somebody \[ has , \+ \] making a decision what * to do *T*-3 with them *T*-4 . E_S 
156841:9	###SpeakerB74 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###but , N_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###Are you for it ? E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###I 'm for it \[ in \+ in \] some cases . E_S 
156977:16	###\[ and \+ and , \] uh , \[ get , \+ they get \] donations from the community , you know , \[ they 're real , \+ \] And from corporations \[ around the , \+ around the \] city , you know , for AIDS research and that kind of thing E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###SpeakerA41 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###and , uh , I think 0 there needs *-1 to be more of that sort of on a federal level , you know , rather than just in the places \[ where it 's , \+ you know , where it 's \] predominated so far *T*-3 , because \[ it 's , \+ you know it 's \] bound *-2 to spread . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
157024:72	###SpeakerA59 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###and , uh , I think 0 that would be the most effective support 0 they could get *T*-1 is for other people \[ to understand , \+ you know , try *-2 to understand \] what they 're going through *T*-3 and everything and try *-2 to understand that \[ \[ they 're not , \+ you know , they do n't , \] \+ they do n't \] have *-4 to be just completely cut *-5 off \[ from , \+ from \] the community E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Uh-huh .

157036:46	###SpeakerA65 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###I do n't know . E_S ###I do n't know , Fish . E_S ###What do you think *T*-1 about that subject ? E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###\[ I think 0 it 's , \+ I think 0 it stands \] a really interesting question of , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###So , uh , you know , my feeling is that , uh , it 's really being used *-1 today , E_S 
157046:26	###\[ \[ \[ it , \+ it , you know , \] \+ it , \] \+ it \] really is n't doing any real good purpose for anything because it 's not cost effective because of the amount of time 0 the people end up *-1 waiting on appeal *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Right , E_S ###I think 0 I 've seen some statistics that *T*-1 say that , uh , it *EXP*-2 's more expensive *ICH*-3 * to kill somebody than * to keep them in prison for life . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Right E_S ###because \[ \[ y- , \+ you , \] \+ you 've \] got \[ all , \+ all \] the prison expenses , plus all the legal expenses . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . 
157097:26	###There are cases where , you know , twenty , thirty years after the fact of * getting evidence , especially as new technology *ICH*-2 comes along that *T*-1 might prove their innocence , then , oops , E_S I 'm sorry *T*-3 , E_S ###* guess 0 we killed the wrong guy . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] N_S ###yeah , E_S ###once you 've made a decision that way , it *EXP*-1 's a little difficult * to go back on it . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Right , E_S ###\[ you , \+ you \] can apologize nicely , E_S 
157109:179	###SpeakerB22 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###it 's a- , N_S ###the benefit of the doubt to the last iota is , uh , based *-2 on the , uh , person who *T*-1 is accused *-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and , you know , \[ \[ the , \+ I , \] \+ I \] think that , you know , N_S ###and the way 0 it 's being used *-2 now *T*-1 , it 's like you listen to Bush \[ is , \+ \] you know , N_S ###well , where are we going *-2 to impose d- , you know , N_S 
157114:25	###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and , you know , \[ \[ the , \+ I , \] \+ I \] think that , you know , N_S ###and the way 0 it 's being used *-2 now *T*-1 , it 's like you listen to Bush \[ is , \+ \] you know , N_S ###well , where are we going *-2 to impose d- , you know , N_S ###it 's like for drug dealers is the new big thing like in , N_S ###Tsongas is also saying , you know , \[ capital , \+ * make it *EXP*-1 a capital \] crime * to be a major drug dealer . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . 
157121:4	###SpeakerB24 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###And , again , I do n't thing 0 these people care . E_S ###They risk their lives every day . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and , \[ \[ there , \+ there , \] \+ they \] seem that \[ \[ the profit marg- , \+ uh , drug dealers , \] \+ the profit margin 's \] so high that , yeah \[ the , \+ the \] risk is almost not there . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Yeah . E_S 
157129:131	###SpeakerA27 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###SpeakerA29 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ and , \+ and , \] you know , uh , especially , now , I live \[ in , \+ in \] Massachusetts , you know , E_S ###\[ \[ w- , \+ w- , \] \+ we 're \] going *-1 to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . 
157161:54	###SpeakerB40 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###And , you know , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 when you listen to like \[ \[ the , uh , \+ the , \] \+ the \] victims ' families and things *T*-2 , they 're always talking about , you know , uh , *-1 feeling justified or feeling , you know , like they 've gotten something out of it , E_S ###I mean , my thought has been , 0 once the guy has been imprisoned *-1 , if he goes to jail forever or whatever , if he gets killed *-2 , it should n't make any difference to \[ the , \+ uh , the \] victim 's family . E_S ###The only thing that *T*-1 should really ###, I mean , N_S obviously , if someone of mine who *T*-1 has close died , I 'd probably feel differently , E_S ###but you know , \[ \[ th- , \+ you know , what , \] \+ the \] important thing is that they be caught *-1 and not be a danger to society . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Right . E_S 
157169:61	###SpeakerB42 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###SpeakerB44 . ###Right E_S ###and that , N_S ###and , you know , also by * keeping them in prison , you do have the possibility , though , we do n't currently do this , of *-1 making restitution . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Right , E_S ###I mean , the , N_S 
157185:27	###I was reading through a book on , uh , \[ geneo , \+ human geneo \] research E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###and there , more and more things like schizophrenia N_S ###and why , does it just turn out *-1 to be genetic or biochemical in origin *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###So if someday we can go to Jeff Dahlmer and say , well , the problem is 0 \[ you , \+ you 've \] got an endorphin imbalance E_S 
157195:46	###and , you know , if you take this regularly , you 'll be a sane and productive member of society you know , E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###you really get back to the question of , you know , is someone responsible for their actions . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 on some of it , you have *-1 to say 0 someone 's responsible for his actions .

157290:15	###SpeakerB24 . ###Autocrossing is , N_S ###what kind of track is that *T*-1 ?

157469:20	###but they 're running under the assump- , N_S ###you know , the way 0 they 're running it now *T*-1 , they 're \[ h- , \+ \] you know , running it under a deficit spending , you know , while we 're not under a recession , E_S ###so there 's never any surplus coming in * to counter the deficit that we 're running *T*-1 , E_S ###so that 's kind of a basic thing of economics , I guess 0 *T*-3 , * keep *-1 spending , * keep *-2 going into debt , E_S ###you 're not going *-1 to payoff what you owe *T*-2 , E_S ###\[ but , \+ so , \] I guess 0 \[ the , \+ the \] question was more like , uh , do you \[ get what you pay f- , \+ you know , get what you pay for *T*-1 . \] E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Well , I , N_S ###it just depends .

157494:84	###SpeakerA13 . ###I guess , N_S ###\[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] a student right now E_S ###and I do n't make a whole lot of money E_S ###and , so , \[ I , \+ I \] kind of do n't pay a proportionate amount of taxes \[ to , \+ \] I guess , uh , compared to what I get *T*-1 , because \[ I , \+ \] you know , all \[ my , \+ my \] education is state sponsored . E_S ###I go to a state sponsored school E_S ###and , uh , my education all up through high school and stuff , N_S ###so I guess 0 I 'm kind of in debt , \[ I , \+ I \] suppose , because I do n't , you know , been paying taxes \[ all that , \+ all that \] long . E_S ###My parents , I guess 0 *T*-1 , \[ \[ h- , \+ h- , \] \+ however , \] have contributed to that , you know , for the education side of it and everything , E_S ###but , uh , I usually end up *-1 getting money back .

157569:39	###SpeakerB42 . ###But you probably pay more *ICH*-1 percentage wise in other taxes . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###There was that , N_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . ###which *T*-1 can- , N_S ###was it Jerry Brown , E_S ###one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for * doing away with all \[ the , \+ the \] tax codes 0 they have *T*-1 now and implementing \[ a f- , \+ I think a flat \] percentage , something like that . E_S 
157583:118	###SpeakerA47 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###And , so , if they penalize businesses , business people are smart enough *-1 to say , here 's *T*-2 my break point , ###I 'm not going *-3 to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###SpeakerA51 . ###Exactly . E_S 
157630:65	###And \[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 it *EXP*-1 would be wrong * to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if , you know , six or seven voted * not guilty , then instead of it being a hung jury , that was an acquittal . E_S ###But I do n't know whether you need \[ an , \+ a \] unanimous , uh , vote of not guilty *-1 to acquit . E_S ###SpeakerB9 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ that , \+ that \] would be an interesting change . E_S ###It was also allow the , uh , idea that if you had one person who *T*-1 was , uh , very disagreeable that ###, I mean , \[ it , \+ it \] fundamentally changes the way 0 the processing occurs *T*-2 because , uh , \[ the fact that it 's w- , \+ \[ the , \+ the \] principle is that the fact that it 's \] unanimous insures the beyond a reasonable doubt , uh , criterion that it , uh , increases \[ the , \+ the \] likelihood of * getting the proper judgment .

157637:53	###So , \[ I , \+ I \] think , 0 if anything , it would have *-1 to be a very close to unanimous decision . E_S ###SpeakerA10 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I 'd agree with that .

157718:11	###SpeakerA7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###He helps me out a lot E_S ###and I get paid *-1 monthly , E_S ###so that 's kind of hard * to have a budget .

158100:6	###so , uh , \[ \[ I , \+ I \] \+ MUMBLEx I \] talk to parents about this a lot .

E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###SpeakerA69 . ###Uh-huh .

159326:39	###SpeakerA27 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###SpeakerA29 . ###That 's true .

159419:37	###I 'm not talking about your isolated occurrences , E_S ###I 'm talking more about \[ the , \+ you know , the \] thing that they know *T*-1 , E_S ###maybe they 're willfully manufacturing something that they know 0 *T*-1 is hurting people out there E_S ###and they continue *-1 to do it even after they become aware of that .

160750:9	###\[ and , \+ and \] Sweden does n't want *-1 to do other thing E_S ###and \[ they 're , \+ they 've \] all got their own reasons which *T*-1 have *-2 to be resolved *-3 yet .

160799:19	###SpeakerB2 . ###No , E_S ###I would tend *-1 to agree very highly . E_S ###I think that we 're all paying a little bit too much taxes and not seeing too much good come out of it . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Do you get hit *-1 up for local taxes there ? E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Yeah , E_S ###we sure do . E_S ###Here in Indiana \[ we pay , \+ uh , we pay \] county income tax , state income tax , E_S 
160829:35	###SpeakerA13 . ###No , E_S ###actually there 's no sales tax in New Hampshire either . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###There 's no sales tax either ? E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###No , E_S ###what there is *T*-1 , is very high property taxes because that 's how they fund schools and everything *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
160841:8	###so \[ they \+ they \] hit me up for the five percent there . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###SpeakerB20 . ###Taxachusetts E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Yep , E_S ###but , it , N_S ###well , you know , we , N_S 
160860:15	###SpeakerB26 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###But , at least on things like stock options and things like that , they do n't tax me . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###So that 's not too bad . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###No , E_S 
160916:19	###I think 0 government does a better space program than you 're going *-1 to get *?* out of private individuals , E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###but , you know , I think , you know , 0 you look at things like , you know , tax subsidies to tobacco farmers because Jesse Helms wants it that way E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###\[ \[ or , \+ You know , and , \] \+ and \] just tremendous amounts of , you know , N_S ###SpeakerB52 .

E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###\[ \[ or , \+ You know , and , \] \+ and \] just tremendous amounts of , you know , N_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###That 's right , E_S ###* got *-1 to keep those farmers happy . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###so much of it , is now just going *-1 to service debt or you know , is going \[ \[ in , \+ into , \] \+ into \] programs that , you know , N_S ###SpeakerB54 . 
160936:26	###I think that a lot of \[ the , \+ the \] H E W services , although they 're providing necessary services , have too much fat in them . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Right . E_S ###\[ The- , \+ there \] is just way too much bureaucracy E_S ###and so much of that tax money is going just * to keep that bureaucracy running , keep the paper shuffling around instead of real , you know , good programs . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###You know , like we , N_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###SpeakerA59 . ###Yeah , E_S 
160955:14	###and our taxes just are going *-1 to keep *-2 rising no matter what *T*-3 happens E_S ###and especially when you 've got the Bush administration who *T*-1 has increased government expenditures , uh , beyond what any other President since World War Two has done *T*-2 *T*-3 E_S ###and yet he supposedly , N_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Well , \[ be- , \+ between \] him and Reagan , E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###SpeakerA63 . ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Right , E_S 
160983:22	###because like in New Hampshire , they say , oh , all right , * let 's cut the military budget . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Well , yeah , E_S ###then , you lose half your jobs in New Hampshire E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###you lose , N_S 
160994:7	###so , you know , \[ it 's like , \+ you know , it *EXP*-1 's very \] tricky * to balance that stuff off , because then you hurt , you know , N_S ###\[ \[ if the , \+ if the , \] \+ if \] people lose their jobs , then they become a load E_S ###and they 're not contributing taxes . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###So , you know , \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] very hard * to say , you know , this is what we should cut *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's really , N_S 
161082:22	###SpeakerA17 . ###SpeakerB18 . ###and I said , well , \[ we wo n't tell him 0 it 's a c- , \+ we wo n't tell her 0 it 's a cat , \] because it was a kitten , E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###SpeakerB20 . ###and , you know , \[ they just , \+ they just \] love kittens . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###They just are fascinated . E_S 
161134:4	###They 're good temperament . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###They 're a good temperament E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###They put up with a lot . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###\[ and they , \+ and they \] just , uh , N_S ###they , N_S I think 0 they have a good head on their shoulders . E_S ###I think 0 they have \[ a , \+ a \] higher level of intelligence than other , uh , dogs that I have encountered *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . 
161173:61	###SpeakerA55 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###I guess 0 it 's up to the individual and how they relate to their animal *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I mean , some people seem fairly well suited \[ for \+ for , \] uh , miniature poodles and such . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Um , And bull dogs . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . 
161296:21	###SpeakerB112 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA113 . ###and , you know , they should expect something like that to happen . E_S ###And so bas- , N_S ###now it 's like ferrets are outlawed *-1 in the town . E_S ###SpeakerB114 . ###Oh , did it attack the child , then ? E_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###Yeah , E_S 
161341:13	###and that 's , uh , an interesting one 0 for me to talk about *T*-1 since I have no children , E_S ###but I did run a child care facility for a while . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###And , uh , * have some , N_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Well , \[ you should , \+ you should \] have some opinions on that , then . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###I do have some thoughts on that , E_S 
161376:8	###SpeakerA17 . ###Oh , absolutely . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###SpeakerA19 . ###As a matter of fact , I believe that the safety \[ and , \+ and \] health , uh , issues , uh , depend in a very direct way on the people who *T*-1 are working with the children . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Exactly . E_S ###And that was the most difficult thing of all , * to find \[ the , \+ the \] right people , the qualified people . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###And it *EXP*-1 's the most difficult of all for a parent , judge , uh because a person can be very nice and warm and loving , E_S 
161393:71	###and I did n't want *-1 to run an institution where that was the case *T*-2 , where all 0 we were doing *T*-3 were warehousing *T*-4 because the first four , five years or so important E_S ###and you have *-1 to have the right kind of enrichment E_S ###and \[ that , \+ that \] includes , uh , an atmosphere in which the child is safe \[ and , \+ and \] he 's watched *-1 and his physical needs are cared for *-2 *T*-3 , E_S ###but also his , uh , developmental needs are cared for *-1 , too . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Maybe the right thing 0 * to do *T*-1 is * to , uh , ###when a couple has a child *T*-2 , then \[ they should both take , \+ you say 0 the first four or five years are the most important , and I think 0 I would agree with that , they both take \] four or five years off and devote to parenting . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###That would be lovely . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . 
161396:51	###but also his , uh , developmental needs are cared for *-1 , too . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Maybe the right thing 0 * to do *T*-1 is * to , uh , ###when a couple has a child *T*-2 , then \[ they should both take , \+ you say 0 the first four or five years are the most important , and I think 0 I would agree with that , they both take \] four or five years off and devote to parenting . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###That would be lovely . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###* Get rid *-1 of all these child care centers , at least for young kids below the age of six . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
161400:11	###SpeakerB26 . ###That would be lovely . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###* Get rid *-1 of all these child care centers , at least for young kids below the age of six . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###\[ And then \+ , uh , and then , \] of course , * to make up for that , uh , the , uh , parents would have *-1 to work in their later years longer , you know , E_S ###in other words , they probably \[ would not work , \+ \] \[ may not , en- , \+ may end \] up *-1 not working at all \[ d- , \+ \] in the twenties . ###Uh , E_S 
161431:25	###SpeakerB40 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###So I think 0 a person could work , uh , into the seventies , eighties , even nineties for that matter , E_S ###if they did n't have *-1 to do a lot of physical , uh , labor , they could \[ main- , \+ maintain , \] uh , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###So , what kind of music you into *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , I have a , uh , pretty wide taste , uh , in music , ranging from progressive rock to jazz to , uh , lot of different forms of , uh , music . E_S ###In fact , it *ICH*-2 's easier for me to say , uh , 0 the types of music that I do n't like *T*-3 are opera and , uh , screaming heavy metal . E_S 
161473:13	###and it 's not really that they 've changed their musical style so much as 0 the stream changed . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's , a lot of people \[ l- , \+ like , \] saying that , you know , bands in that position , you know , sold out . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###I think 0 that 's pretty much , you know , bull . E_S ###Because R E M really has n't changed . E_S 
161726:17	###Is that centrally located E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###It 's , uh , well , N_S ###you ever heard of Lufkin ? E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Uh , no , E_S ###\[ what , \+ what \] major city *T*-1 is nearby ? E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Houston . E_S 
161747:4	###SpeakerA59 . ###Oh , okay , E_S ###all right . E_S ###Well , that sounds pretty good . E_S ###Does , uh , N_S ###I guess 0 the weather , N_S ###does that stay pretty constant there E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###\[ It 's , \+ it 's \] gets cold at night , and then warm in the afternoons . E_S 
161945:28	###SpeakerB2 . ###SpeakerA3 . ###but , It 's out of control . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh , yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh , well , uh , out of control , I do n't know . E_S ###I guess 0 it could be worse . E_S 
162352:25	###SpeakerB82 . ###Yeah E_S ###that , N_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###\[ \[ \[ I do n't know what kind of , \+ I do n't know what G M corporate , \] \+ kind of hit the , \] \+ I do n't know what kind of hit \] they take *T*-1 on it , E_S ###but * sounds like everybody 's had their chance * to make their money off it E_S ###\[ \[ and , \+ So , \] \+ but , \] uh , I do n't know , E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I 'm sure 0 they did .

162385:6	###although I saw a survey recently E_S ###and \[ I 'm actually making just about as much as , \+ you know , I 'm \[ m- , \+ making \] actually \[ over average , \+ over the average \] \] for my career , my experience and all that stuff which *T*-1 kind of surprised me .

162473:24	###The dental plan , I pay absolutely nothing because , uh N_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Wow .

162496:111	###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###SpeakerB54 . ###SpeakerA55 . ###Uh , and benefits , through the government are , uh , really , N_S ###uh , \[ they just , \+ uh , they 're not the greatest . \] E_S ###Uh , \[ I , \+ before \[ I , \+ I , \] \] uh , uh , got my degree N_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Uh , E_S 
162543:22	###and , uh there 's a lot of different things that they do *T*-1 , lot of different divisions \[ even this area , \+ *ICH*-3 in the San Francisco Bay Area \] that they do *T*-2 , E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###so there 's , N_S ###I , myself have moved around quite a bit within the company E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###\[ \[ and it 's , \+ and I , \] \+ and I \] have n't had *-1 to move my residence * to do that . E_S 
162635:38	###SpeakerA19 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###right . E_S ###That 's how \[ they , \+ uh , they \] bind themselves together in groups *T*-2 , I guess 0 *T*-1 E_S ###and , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Now , the , N_S ###interestingly enough , I do n't think 0 we have here , \[ a , \+ a \] lot of gangs , but , uh , \[ only a couple , uh of , \+ not a whole large group of \] them , but , uh , just a few . Most of them centered * around , uh , drug territory . E_S 
162715:37	###Uh , there 's no way 0 they can stop the drugs *T*-1 , E_S ###and that 's what *T*-1 's causing all the killing . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Well , uh , there 's a couple of things that I 've heard *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###SpeakerB50 . ###uh , most of them are fairly , uh , radical in terms of what you 'd have *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . 
162780:72	###SpeakerA75 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###SpeakerA77 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Uh , and prohibition did n't stop it and did n't do anything really * to slow , N_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . 
162821:24	###But , there , too , there are also cases in which I feel 0 a majority rule might be acceptable *T*-1 , particularly , I think in civil cases . E_S ###In criminal cases , I 'd like *-1 to see the \[ unani- , \+ unanimity \] remain , E_S ###but in civil cases , I think 0 a majority rule \[ by , \+ by \] jury would be sufficient . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Well , uh , could you give me an example of a case where you think that *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Well , in a criminal case , say one in which , you know , there is , like , say assault or some such *T*-1 . I think 0 there ought *-2 to be a unanimous , uh , vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this . E_S ###And in civil law there , you know , is such a thing as like , * let 's say , uh , misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that . E_S ###A majority rule , I think 0 *T*-1 , would be more in line as there is no real smoking gun in the civil cases . E_S ###I do n't know if I 'm making any sense or not . E_S 
162858:56	###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah , E_S ###many laws , but little justice . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Say , N_S ###but , uh , N_S ###and I also think , just like you were talking about *ICH*-1 before , why you were chosen *-3 to be on a jury *T*-2 that , uh , \[ \[ the , \+ just , \] \+ the \] process of * picking jurors is not always objective . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Oh , certainly not , E_S ###certainly not . E_S

163523:8	###and \[ I , \+ I \] think that drugs , N_S ###they do test for drugs in that capacity , E_S ###but it 's not their exclusive , N_S ###\[ it 's just part , \+ it 's just something \] that *T*-1 turns up in the other parameters that they test for *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###But I think 0 it 's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have *-1 to exercise some quick judgment in the field . E_S ###What is the nature of your company 's business *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB18 . 
163570:6	###and I have many a time called him *-1 to come *-2 get me , you know . E_S ###\[ And , \+ uh , uh , but , \] \[ y- , \+ you know , \] they do n't think twice about *-1 serving beer by the keg . You know , E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###but , uh , I think 0 drug testing , N_S ###and \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know , E_S ###\[ \[ I guess \+ I k- , \] \+ I think \] 0 it 's got some relevance , E_S ###but I think 0 its relevance is pretty limited . E_S ###I mean , I think , you know , N_S 
163579:18	###I mean , I think , you know , N_S ###in your case , I do n't think that you should necessarily be subjected *-1 to drug testing . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###I think 0 that 's an interesting policy 0 your company has *T*-1 about testing immediately after an on the job accident . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ it 's really , \+ it 's really \] bizarre . E_S ###Uh , particularly , like where we are *T*-1 , you know . E_S 
163585:35	###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ it 's really , \+ it 's really \] bizarre . E_S ###Uh , particularly , like where we are *T*-1 , you know . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I , \] N_S ###there was a story of a woman last year \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-1 actually did slip on the ice \[ and , \+ and \] like sprained her ankle E_S ###and \[ she , \+ she \] was a personnel secretary E_S ###and she had *-1 to get tested *-2 E_S ###and , I do n't know E_S ###I 'm ambivalent about the whole thing . E_S 
163623:41	###You go in there with the doctor , E_S ###he makes you take off all your clothes E_S ###and then he examines you . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Steve , uh , with the election year and whatnot coming up , do you think 0 we ought *-1 to cut taxes , raise them , E_S ###\[ \[ or , \+ or , \] \+ or \] what do you think *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] a really hard question . E_S ###I do know that , uh , politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths . E_S ###Uh , I N_S 
163663:25	###\[ but , \+ but \] supposedly once you have an office in D C , \[ or , \+ \] you know , \[ and , \+ and \] staff it with people , it *EXP*-1 's really tough * to close it down E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] they just have n't *?* yet . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Well , yeah , E_S ###I 'm not exactly sure , uh , about polio in particular . E_S ###I know 0 we have a polio vaccine come 0 *T*-2 will prevent somebody from *-1 getting polio E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###I 'm not sure if we know what * to do *T*-2 in terms of * curing some who *T*-1 has already gotten polio . E_S 
163685:155	###SpeakerA15 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###and the poor President \[ has , \+ has \] *-1 to , uh , either accept or reject the whole thing .

E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###SpeakerB20 . 
163701:131	###SpeakerA23 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###So \[ I 'm not , \+ I 'm not \] sure \[ that , \+ that \] that will help *-1 solve our problems , E_S ###but there definitely \[ is , \+ is \] a problem with , N_S ###uh , I forgot , E_S ###there 's a political term for this stuff , pork barrel or something . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . 
163751:11	###SpeakerB2 . ###Uh , well , I do n't know exactly what *T*-1 's hot down in Texas . E_S ###I know what *T*-1 's hot down here with me , E_S ###so that 's about all 0 I can feel apt *-1 to discuss *T*-2 with you since I just know , N_S ###I do n't ever listen to the radio E_S ###and that 's usually what *T*-1 's hot around here E_S ###\[ so , \+ So , \] what kind of music do you like *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . 
163857:21	###It 's becoming not necessarily good music , just popular music , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Hey , E_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] think 0 most artists are in *-1 to make a few bucks .

163907:26	###so \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ it *EXP*-2 's \] really backwards how things are working now *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###but , N_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ \[ i- , \+ i- , \] \+ it 's \] the artist , not the merit . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Yeah , E_S 
163979:20	###and very often the artist will have \[ a d- , \+ an album \] E_S ###and , so if you like the artist , you buy the album . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###So you definitely get *-1 to try before you buy . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###that 's definitely N_S 
163999:4	###Uh , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] lower than it has been *?* in the past . E_S ###Uh , I guess 0 nineteen ninety is when it start *-2 to drop off *T*-1 , E_S ###and usually around the Christmas season is usually when the crime rate is a little bit higher *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I , N_S ###that 's probably not true only for Atlanta , but for just about anywhere . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Uh , what kind of crime problem do you usually run into *T*-1 ? E_S 
164002:16	###SpeakerA3 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I , N_S ###that 's probably not true only for Atlanta , but for just about anywhere . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Yeah .

164002:34	###SpeakerA3 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I , N_S ###that 's probably not true only for Atlanta , but for just about anywhere . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Yeah .

164169:20	###SpeakerB24 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###and , other than that , uh , you know , reasonable cost and safety and , uh , as much economy as you can get *?* out of a car .

164289:14	###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] wonder \[ if , \+ uh , if \] drug use is a more prevalent crime , though , because , I mean , so many people use it , E_S ###and even though * just using is not really , N_S ###I mean it is a crime , E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Oh , well , yeah , E_S ###\[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ that \] is a crime . E_S ###I guess , uh , 0 \[ when you , \+ when you \] count all the little things that people do *T*-1 like *T*-2 , N_S ###uh , speeding is a crime . E_S 
164292:66	###and even though * just using is not really , N_S ###I mean it is a crime , E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Oh , well , yeah , E_S ###\[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ that \] is a crime . E_S ###I guess , uh , 0 \[ when you , \+ when you \] count all the little things that people do *T*-1 like *T*-2 , N_S ###uh , speeding is a crime . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Well , that 's true . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . 
164299:9	###SpeakerA7 . ###Well , that 's true . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###I break that law every day . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###But \[ I was , \+ \[ I , \+ I \] was \] staying in the realm \[ of , \+ of \] felonies versus misdemeanors and , uh , drug use , E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###well , actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor , E_S 
164309:14	###but , uh , \[ what kind , \+ what kind , \] N_S ###\[ have you been , \+ uh , have you been \] the subject of such a crime , such as stealing , or anything ? E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Well , \[ I 've , \+ uh , I 've \] been caught *-1 with marijuana before , E_S ###so I guess 0 that was a crime . E_S ###I got a year 's probation for that , E_S ###but , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###\[ That , \+ that 's \] not that much . E_S ###I mean you know , those are n't , N_S 
164329:14	###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 it is *?* . E_S ###\[ I , \+ \] in some ways , it 's almost worse than murder . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's very degrading E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerB22 . 
164355:64	###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###it 's a pretty good thing . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###I agree with that . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###\[ They , \+ they \] have that down here in Florida still . E_S ###\[ They \+ the \] electric chair E_S ###and , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA33 . 
164367:14	###SpeakerB34 . ###Oh , do they ? E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 that 's still an appropriate penalty 0 * to pay *T*-1 if they absolutely sure 0 they got the right guy E_S ###and , I guess 0 usually \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] always sure 0 they got the right guy , E_S ###but , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 the appeal process takes too long . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . 
164376:18	###SpeakerB36 . ###Yeah , E_S ###so do *T*-1 I . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###\[ I think , \+ \[ I , \+ I \] think \] 0 it \[ should take , \+ from conviction to execution should take \] no longer than a year . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ i- , \+ if \] that . E_S ###You know , the sooner , N_S ###\[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ a \] year 's plenty of time you know , for something to come out , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S 
164391:10	###and they , N_S ###it 's like oops , . E_S ###But , ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Well , yeah , E_S ###I mean , the system is n't perfect , E_S ###I mean , it 's run *-1 by a bunch of imperfect humans . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###SpeakerA43 . 
164398:16	###I mean , it 's run *-1 by a bunch of imperfect humans .

E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###But , I think 0 you have *-1 to accept some of the errors . E_S ###I think that murder itself would decrease significantly \[ if , \+ if \] there was a credible punishment , uh , for murderers . E_S 
164463:36	###SpeakerB70 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###SpeakerB72 . ###Yeah , E_S ###they could \[ p- , \+ probably \] do it again . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Yes , E_S ###\[ they , \+ they \] would have no problems *-1 doing it again . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . 
164487:29	###but I do n't think that it really actually does that . E_S ###I do n't think 0 it deters anybody , because most of the time crimes \[ are , \+ uh , are \] committed *-1 \[ with a , \+ without any \] thought to the consequences E_S ###and they do n't \[ think that , \+ uh , stop and think and say , \] well , maybe I should n't do this , uh , because , uh , I might get the gas chamber or something like that . E_S ###They worry about it afterwards E_S ###and then they try and get out of it . E_S ###And , uh , how about you ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , I think that in some cases , it is warranted . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh , E_S 
164545:36	###SpeakerA29 . ###Right . E_S ###* Have *-1 to agree with you , E_S ###and I 'm kind of \[ i- , \+ in \] favor of capital punishment also . E_S ###I just do n't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because , uh , you still see them committing the same crimes , E_S ###but , I tend *-1 to agree with you that , uh , we should have it . E_S ###\[ I just , \+ I \] do n't know that it 's always effective , E_S ###but I guess 0 \[ we , \+ uh , we 're \] kind of stuck with it . E_S ###\[ It 's , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] a difficult , uh , problem , is n't it *?* , * to determine how you 're going *-2 to punish somebody for a particular crime *T*-3 , uh , E_S ###SpeakerB30 . 
164703:27	###SpeakerA15 . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###and occasionally in the morning , I 'll pick up something like , uh , C N N or that , E_S ###but I hate *-1 watching the , like , ten o'clock news E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah , E_S ###so you have a paper or something or , N_S ###SpeakerB18 . 
164784:78	###In fact , it was kind of weird , because \[ \[ I met the , \+ uh , I met the , \] \+ I met the \] editor , uh , \[ while I was on , \+ uh , while I was \] doing jury service in Santa Monica one time .

E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Although \[ I , \+ you know , I 'm \] sorry *-1 to see some of their , uh , N_S ###\[ there 's , \+ there 's \] a daily \[ news , \+ uh , news \] rack right around the corner from where I live *T*-2 , which *T*-1 means that \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] expanding , I guess 0 *T*-3 . E_S 
164818:28	###It 's basically anything that *T*-2 's south of downtown , they do n't bother *-1 to cover *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Now , they have started here *-1 running a three day , or three times a week Plano section . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###And it 's just sort of \[ a , \+ \] you know , four or five pages that *T*-1 covers what *T*-2 's going on in Plano . E_S ###But it 's still not an awful lot of news . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Yeah , E_S 
164853:23	###and she watches a lot of the cable news network . E_S ###\[ Have you seen , \+ uh , \[ h- , \+ \+ have \] you , uh , ever heard \] of ALL THINGS CONSIDERED * ?

E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###I can hear it at \[ the , \+ uh , uh , oh , the \] college town nearby when I 'm in Stillwater , which *T*-2 is about an hour away *T*-1 , E_S ###but the F M signal does n't reach this far . E_S 
164863:12	###SpeakerB5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA6 . ###Uh , I 'll listen to shortwave quite a bit .

E_S ###SpeakerA8 . ###Uh , I agree with you , too , on \[ the , \+ uh , uh , the \] cable channel , C N N and HEADLINE NEWS .

164890:6	###\[ It 's , \+ B B C \[ \[ is , \+ uh , oh , I do n't know the right word , is , \] \+ is \] \] almost , uh , N_S ###they almost take all emotions out of it when they report it *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###Do you think , then , that , uh , the American media is presenting an opinion along with their facts ? E_S ###SpeakerA20 . 
164908:20	###SpeakerB23 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###\[ Which , \+ uh , which \] approach do you find *T*-1 to be , uh , more useful , \[ the , \+ ###the \] interpretive approach or the straight reporting ?

E_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###So \[ I , \+ overall , I \] think 0 I would rather *-1 hear just straight reporting . E_S ###SpeakerB31 . ###One of the things that I found *T*-1 interesting last year during \[ the , \+ uh , the \] Gulf conflict was a sentiment against , uh , Peter Arnett , who *T*-2 had stayed in Iraq and was presenting , uh , some of the things that *T*-3 were available . E_S ###Uh , \[ there was a , \+ there was , uh , a \] piece where he was showing a bombed out building where there was obviously a \[ crudely , \+ uh , uh , hastily \] erected sign saying baby milk factory *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S 
165043:45	###SpeakerB36 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###SpeakerB40 . ###Yeah . E_S 
165242:7	###SpeakerB39 . ###And can you think of any other industry where ###in software they , N_S ###SpeakerA40 . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerB41 . ###if the product is upgraded *-2 and a better version is put *-1 out , you 'll get a free version in the mail s- , MUMBLEx .

165376:24	###and N_S so \[ I , \+ I \] stay on top of that E_S ###but \[ I \+ I \] wanted my front wheels , E_S ###I wanted the bearings packed *-1 E_S ###and they wanted something like fifteen dollars , uh , a front or something like that E_S ###or maybe it *EXP*-1 was thirty dollars * to do it E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###* Just to pack the bearings ? E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###* just to pack the bearings , E_S ###but what I found *T*-1 is that they had a brake job E_S

165937:8	###Actually , \[ my , \+ my \] wife and I are actually \[ thinking , \+ contemplating \] *-1 buying a new car in the next year and a half or so . E_S ###So we 're actually been looking around and thinking about things . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###We 'd like *-1 to get like a N_S ###oh , I do n't know . E_S ###What do you call it *T*-1 ? E_S ###A dealer return type thing on a ninety-two and ninety-three or something like that you know . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . 
165971:6	###But \[ wh- , \+ what \] kind of things are you looking for *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Well , the Saturns you can get air bags in them . E_S ###I do n't think 0 you can get dual side air bags . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###But one of \[ the , \+ the \] two things that I 'm really , N_S ###\[ \[ the , \+ the \] \+ I 'd say 0 the \] most important thing is a car that *T*-1 's not going *-2 to fall apart . That *T*-3 does n't have problems . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . 
165980:52	###SpeakerB64 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###You set down . E_S ###You look at consumer reports . E_S ###We 've been pouring over consumer reports E_S ###and you just get so depressed for the U S auto makers when you do that *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . 
165992:76	###SpeakerB68 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###And the other one \[ is , \+ are \] the Saturns . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###So those two things . E_S ###And then , you know , we kind of want a four door . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . 
166027:54	###a bottle bill was passed *-1 E_S ###and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now , E_S ###and the majority of the incentive in * recycling bottles probably , * believe it or not , is just * to get the extra nickel at \[ the , uh , \+ the \] store and not , uh , N_S ###that 's the majority of people that I know of *T*-1 anyways . E_S ###Where people are n't really , you know , eco conscious *T*-3 . It 's just the fact that it 's something 0 they have *-2 to do *T*-1 . E_S ###And I 'm not going *-1 to throw a bottle away , E_S ###it 's like * throwing a nickel away . E_S ###That type of thing . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Right . E_S 
166124:26	###SpeakerB10 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Uh , but I do agree that , uh , generally \[ it 's , \+ society \] has sort of , uh , * let 's see , rushed everything ahead . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###And , uh , I do n't know , E_S ###it \[ leaves , \+ leaves \] a lot of time out for family and things like that . E_S ###In other words , they just prioritize their lives differently . E_S 
166139:18	###SpeakerA15 . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###SpeakerA17 . ###Um . It depends . E_S ###Uh , it *EXP*-2 's hard 0 * to say *T*-1 because I think 0 people were busy ten twenty years ago too . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Uh , I just , N_S 
166306:90	###it 's high in those areas where also there 's poverty \[ and , \+ and \] crime *T*-1 . E_S ###And they all seem *-2 to go together . E_S ###And it seems like if you could eliminate one \[ of , \+ of \] the parts of that circle , \[ whether , \+ where \] you have the dropout rate and crime and , you know , general poverty kind of conditions *T*-1 , that things ought *-2 to get better . E_S ###So , uh , \[ a- , \+ the other two \[ a- , \+ a- , \] \] N_S ###they *ICH*-1 're all three social issues and could be addressed *-2 by the government in any ways . And clearly , to me , is a kind of government thing 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] fix *T*-3 E_S ###but it 's just like , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't expect them to know \[ \[ which , \+ which , \] \+ which \] part *T*-1 is best 0 * to fix *T*-2 just like I do n't know . E_S ###\[ It 's , \+ it 's \] a complicated issue . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] still do n't think 0 I would blame it directly on the school . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###I do n't know if I blame it on the school . E_S 
166439:13	###but you know , he , N_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###SpeakerA27 . ###* To be honest with you , \[ I , \+ I \] probably watch , uh , college a little bit more than I do pro . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Really ? E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Yeah . E_S 
166476:6	###but , N_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Yeah . E_S ###You probably would n't like my favorite team in college then . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###\[ Who- , \+ who 's \] that *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###SpeakerB42 . ###Notre Dame ? E_S ###SpeakerA43 .

166526:6	###SpeakerA57 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###so . N_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###\[ That 's , \+ that 's , \] N_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###So , uh , what 's d- , N_S 
166613:4	###SpeakerA85 . ###Yeah , MUMBLEx . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ there 's an element \+ there 's definitely an element \] of stupidity in there somewhere . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah . E_S ###That 's just wild . E_S ###That 's why it 's \[ a go- , \+ a \] big college thing *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###Yeah E_S 
166625:4	###SpeakerA89 . ###Right , E_S ###exactly . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###Tha- , N_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###So , yeah , E_S ###I could see the feel for that . E_S ###But \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's pretty , \] \+ it 's \] fun 0 * to play *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . 
166731:77	###That is something that *T*-1 is not required *-2 E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Well , yo- , N_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###SpeakerA5 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###and , in fact , uh , it is actually prohibited *-1 E_S ###but it does n't stop \[ many people \+ many people \] \[ from , \+ uh , from \] *-1 doing it . E_S ###And it 's \[ \[ n- , \+ o- , \] \+ one \] of the things that it 's used *-2 for *T*-1 , primarily , is for demographic , uh , research . E_S And * to get \[ \[ th- , \+ your , \] \+ your \] phone number on , uh , uh , lists for phone solicitations . E_S 
166776:90	###You can always refuse E_S ###but it 's another thing where it 's required *-1 by law *T*-2 E_S ###and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody . You know , E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Right . E_S ###Uh , That , N_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###\[ I do n't think , \+ I do n't think \] 0 they have the right * to do that . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###I agree with you there . E_S 
166795:26	###And they were talking about * selling the D M V lists E_S ###and there was \[ a lot of , \+ uh , a lot of , \] uh , consternation about that E_S ###and the last 0 I heard *T*-1 they 'd backed down from that idea . E_S ###But it really makes you wonder what other lists *ICH*-5 *ICH*-6 you 're own *T*-1 that *T*-2 have been made *-3 , uh , public that you , do n't know about *T*-4 . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###SpeakerB24 . ###SpeakerA25 . ###Well , that 's easy . E_S ###Whenever you donate money to someone *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB26 . 
166860:43	###that 's , just our business . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###SpeakerA47 . ###There 's no need for someone who *T*-1 is soliciting should know at all . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Just , uh , N_S ###and that was very offensive too . E_S ###I , N_S 
166885:6	###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###And he is still living by himself . E_S ###My grandmother died a couple of years ago . E_S ###But he does n't want *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] move away . E_S ###He lives in a little farmhouse on a farm . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . 
166921:97	###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###and I 'm just here for the rest of the stay . E_S ###And so \[ I , \+ you know , I \] guess 0 most of the time when I think about somebody going into a nursing home *T*-1 , it 's more a case of where they are not able *-2 to look after their day-to-day needs *T*-3 . E_S ###Yeah E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###they \[ have \+ can \] look after a lot of things E_S 
166971:48	###SpeakerB2 . ###Uh , I certainly ca n't argue with that . E_S ###* Definitely does need some improvements . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###SpeakerB4 . ###and the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because they want *-1 to *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 there 's a limit on that . E_S 
167026:21	###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###So , uh , I think 0 the jury selection process is pretty neat , E_S ###but I do n't think that the jury ought *-1 to be the ones picking the punishment afterwards . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###I think 0 that should be left *-2 up to people who *T*-1 have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have *?* . E_S ###\[ M- , \+ \] you 're talking about , the person 's already been found *-1 guilty , right E_S 
167030:29	###but I do n't think that the jury ought *-1 to be the ones picking the punishment afterwards . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###I think 0 that should be left *-2 up to people who *T*-1 have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have *?* . E_S ###\[ M- , \+ \] you 're talking about , the person 's already been found *-1 guilty , right E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . 
167047:50	###SpeakerA35 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###SpeakerA37 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###SpeakerA39 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh , and I think 0 that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure . As opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure . Also , may be a more consistent sentencing procedure . E_S 
167066:28	###But when it comes to , uh , sentencing for punishment *T*-1 , of course , if the person 's never done anything bad before , according to the judicial system , then they 're going *-2 to lean towards a slightly more lenient side , E_S ###and the jury 's supposed *-1 to be notified *-2 of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Oh , is it *?* ? E_S ###Oh , I did n't realize that . E_S ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###At least in California , they 're supposed *-1 to be *?* . E_S ###Not during the trial , E_S ###during the trial as to whether they 're guilty or not has nothing 0 * to do *T*-1 with their background . E_S 
167161:13	###The business that you purchase the thing from *T*-1 is responsible for * collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question . E_S ###That 's a cost of * doing business . E_S ###The burden should n't be placed *-1 on the consumer . E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###And \[ \[ I , \+ I \] \+ I \] was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then \[ having , \+ having \] *-1 to pay sales tax on it . E_S ###SpeakerB15 . ###SpeakerA16 . ###SpeakerB17 . ###Uh . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . 
167197:36	###SpeakerA28 . ###That 's true . E_S ###\[ \[ \[ I- , \+ i- , \] \+ a r- , \] \+ a big \] hole does exist right now , uh , in that consumers can just say oh , \[ I , \+ I \] forgot that . E_S ###\[ There , \+ there \] is no well defined mechanism at all E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] that it is \[ a \+ a \] \[ l- , \+ loss . \] \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 *T*-5 is that the Federal government will try *-1 to establish a mechanism \[ \[ ju- , \+ just \] * to do \+ just \[ that \+ \] \[ in or- , \+ in order \] *-3 to \] gain the revenue that *T*-2 's being lost *-4 . E_S ###Uh , I mean , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know if I agree with that . E_S ###\[ But it , \+ but , \] N_S ###SpeakerB29 . ###SpeakerA1 . ###Your turn . E_S 
167264:27	###In other words , \[ you 'd have * to , \+ you 'd have *-2 to \] murder more than one other person uh , in order * to justify * taking his life . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Besides him . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###SpeakerB26 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Another way 0 you could do it *T*-1 is * weight this value by , uh , the value to society of the people . Uh , which *T*-2 is pretty delicate thing 0 * to do *T*-3 . E_S ###But one way of * doing it is , uh , by income . E_S ###So if this guy does n't make a great deal of money , which *T*-1 is often times the case , \[ then \+ then \] he 's obviously not worth very much E_S 
167264:50	###In other words , \[ you 'd have * to , \+ you 'd have *-2 to \] murder more than one other person uh , in order * to justify * taking his life . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Besides him .

167274:12	###SpeakerB28 . ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###His life is n't worth very much then .

E_S ###SpeakerB34 . 
167308:25	###SpeakerB42 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh , and , N_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Was he murdered *-1 ? E_S ###Did they find who *T*-1 killed him ? E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Oh , yes . E_S ###They found him E_S 
167399:8	###SpeakerB29 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###And we 're in the process E_S ###and it started *-1 pouring down rain . E_S ###SpeakerB31 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA32 . ###And I guess 0 we had most of it done *-1 E_S ###but the end was result , N_S 
167518:27	###and it 's had several owners and stuff E_S ###and , uh they have put plastic , Plexiglas kind of stuff in some of the windows . E_S ###SpeakerA74 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB75 . ###SpeakerA76 . ###Oh , these N_S ###so you have the sash windows in ? E_S ###SpeakerB77 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
167582:28	###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh-huh .

167611:6	###SpeakerB16 . ###SpeakerA17 . ###And , uh , we kind of have the same plan .

167840:71	###Because the one 0 I went to *T*-1 was , you know , I 'm sure \[ a , \+ a \] lot nicer than , you know , a lot of the inner city schools and the things around Atlanta . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###SpeakerA15 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ It was \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ it 's a \] more or less a suburban school system ? E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . 
167853:41	###SpeakerB18 . ###SpeakerA19 . ###but \[ I do n't think , \+ I honestly do n't think \] 0 that 's the biggest part of it .

167872:58	###yeah , E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's true .

167915:62	###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah . E_S ###And I think 0 that 's almost a bigger factor , than anything else probably . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###SpeakerA49 . ###I mean , \[ I do n't , \+ I think \] you know , 0 people just , N_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###So , I guess 0 \[ the problem is 0 the , \+ the thing 0 * to do *T*-1 is \] * to try *-2 \[ to , \+ uh , to \] get some kind of motivation * to learn E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerA51 . 
167923:25	###and , N_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Yeah . E_S ###And , again , I do n't , I mean N_S ###they got *-1 to know \[ the , \+ \] you know , how qualified , I mean , MUMBLEx N_S ###I think 0 it *EXP*-2 'd be interesting * \[ to , \+ you know , to \] spend a couple of days * just looking around an inner city school .

E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###SpeakerB54 . 
167996:48	###and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley . E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Huh . E_S ###Well , here in Seattle , uh , \[ it 's g- , \+ the air 's getting \] more and more polluted .

E_S ###They 're \[ ge- , \+ eliminating \] that out here . E_S ###SpeakerB25 . 
168082:15	###and you can look at the emissions actually . E_S ###SpeakerB31 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA32 . ###And ... N_S ###SpeakerB33 . ###Now where does the source light go *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA34 . ###Like across the street . E_S ###They 'll set up like a trap or something like that in some sense . E_S 
168133:5	###SpeakerA2 . ###Well , they just kicked it off down here \[ in , \+ in \] Sarasota county . E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Oh , they did ?

E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA6 . 
168221:56	###SpeakerB37 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###I mean it 's a little extra work . E_S ###SpeakerB39 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA40 . ###And , uh , it can actually turn out *-1 to be a lot of extra work because \[ what they do *T*-2 , \+ what they do *T*-3 \] here in Sarasota county is 0 they 've got , N_S ###SpeakerB41 . ###It can , E_S 
168229:104	###SpeakerB41 . ###It can , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA42 . ###okay , E_S ###you put your garbage in a garbage bag E_S ###and you set it out by the curb . E_S ###SpeakerB43 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA44 . 
168323:27	###Kind of like , N_S ###SpeakerA78 . ###\[ I think 0 in , \+ I think 0 in \] the city they do E_S ###but out here in the county you have *-1 to rent them . E_S ###SpeakerB79 . ###Oh , okay MUMBLEx . E_S ###SpeakerA80 . ###And they just add it on to your water bill or something . E_S ###SpeakerB81 . ###So where exactly are you *T*-1 in terms \[ of , \+ of , \] like , Sarasota ? E_S 
168342:6	###SpeakerA86 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB87 . ###Okay . E_S ###Like south of Tampa , right ? E_S ###SpeakerA88 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB89 . ###Okay . E_S ###I 'm , N_S 
168416:53	###SpeakerB10 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Uh , housing prices are , you know , like from four to ten times more expensive than , uh , uh , they were *?* where I came from *T*-1 in , uh , Dallas . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Oh , you moved from Dallas to San Francisco . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Yeah . E_S ###So , uh uh , that presents \[ a , \+ a \] real shock . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . 
168446:11	###Uh , at least it has n't been *?* . E_S ###It \[ may , \+ may \] be *?* at this point . E_S ###But , uh , up until this point it really has n't been *?* . E_S ###When I , uh , was in , uh , undergraduate school a long , long time ago *T*-1 , I , uh , noted that the \[ monthly salary , \+ starting average monthly \[ salary \+ salary \] \] for engineers \[ that , \+ \] you know , in my discipline , was like oh , six hundred ten dollars a month or something like that . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###And , uh , I noted at that point that \[ I was , \+ you know , if that 's \] what my salary *ICH*-3 was *T*-2 that I drew *T*-1 then I would be making almost twice as much as my father made *?* during his best year ever . E_S ###So I stopped *-1 worrying about money . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . 
168564:26	###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###And we see that more and more . E_S ###Like in our state right now , there 's a fourteen year old boy who *T*-1 raped and then killed a seven year old girl E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###you know , that 's fourteen years old . E_S ###What 's he going *-1 to be doing *T*-2 when he turns into an adult *T*-3 . E_S 
168620:6	###but \[ it 's , \+ but I think 0 it 's \] relatively unimportant compared to what 's the most effective way of , * dealing with crime *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###SpeakerA39 . ###and I guess 0 I would like , N_S ###I do n't know , E_S ###the European countries certainly , uh , none of them have capital punishment E_S ###and \[ they \+ they \] do n't have a crime problem either . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Oh , really . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . 
168640:33	###and \[ the , \+ \] \[ that , \+ that \] bothers me . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###You might be right . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###But it , N_S ###but , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###I mean \[ I , \+ I 'd \] hate *-1 to be the person 0 *T*-2 to pull the switch , you know , E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###SpeakerB48 . 
168782:23	###Uh E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###our thirteen year old son plays violin E_S ###and our , nine year old daughter plays cello E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###Okay . E_S 
168787:14	###and our , nine year old daughter plays cello E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###and , uh , when our son started *-2 playing violin *T*-1 , I took up violin E_S ###and when our daughter started *-2 playing cello *T*-1 , I took up cello . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###SpeakerA33 . 
168788:18	###SpeakerB28 . ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###and , uh , when our son started *-2 playing violin *T*-1 , I took up violin E_S ###and when our daughter started *-2 playing cello *T*-1 , I took up cello . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###SpeakerA33 . ###So there 's \[ plenty of , \+ plenty of \] interactive time in , uh , * practicing . Although neither kid likes *-1 to practice . E_S 
168798:68	###SpeakerB34 . ###SpeakerA35 . ###I guess 0 that 's not a big surprise . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###No . E_S ###Not for kids . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###But \[ I mea- , \+ I imagine \] 0 with infants \[ you are , \+ \] most of your time is sort of spent *-1 * taking care of them rather than interacting with them .

168806:69	###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well \[ I , \+ I \] try and read to them E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###SpeakerB40 . ###and I take them to the park and stuff E_S ###and , Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Oh , you know , reading is so good . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . 
168815:19	###SpeakerB42 . ###SpeakerA43 . ###\[ I , \+ uh , I \] took great pleasure in * reading to my kids when they were little *T*-1 E_S ###and I still try *-1 to read to them , although our son is not liking that anymore . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well , they get to that stage . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Uh , but I read , you know N_S ###there 's this DOCTOR SEUSS sleep book . E_S 
168819:39	###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well , they get to that stage . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Uh , but I read , you know N_S ###there 's this DOCTOR SEUSS sleep book . E_S ###Have you ever seen that yet ? E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Sleep book , E_S ###no . E_S 
168842:42	###SpeakerB52 . ###Oh , really ? E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Well , yeah E_S ###\[ I like * to , \+ I like *-1 to \] do it E_S ###and they enjoy reading .

168871:6	###so she does , uh , Tupperware , E_S ###so she 's gone a lot at nights E_S ###and so I spend a lot of time with them . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Oh , I see .

168938:98	###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###So what that means *T*-1 is , to me , that really it 's the government that *T*-2 's requiring this , E_S ###although they do n't actually \[ e- , \+ execute \] it themselves , it 's really the government that MUMBLEx . N_S ###So , in that sense , \[ it , \+ at least , philosophically , it 's \] really borderline legal . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Well \[ \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 the , \+ I think that , \] you know , a person 's competence should be more determined *-1 by , you know , their actions and their behavior E_S ###and \[ if they 're , \+ you know , if they 're \] on some kind of , you know , \[ contol- , \+ controlled \] substance then , you know , it kinds of takes away from the job of , you know , the supervisor or manager type person , you know , who *T*-1 is able *-2 to evaluate them . E_S 
168956:37	###SpeakerA23 . ###SpeakerB24 . ###SpeakerA25 . ###SpeakerB26 . ###\[ it , \+ uh , it \] destroys their libido . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Yeah , \[ tha- , \+ that \] would be kind of an extreme . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Now , uh , you know if they ever , N_S ###SpeakerA29 . 
169011:41	###and as a matter of fact there are a lot of programs , uh , such as Peace Corps that *T*-1 promote that . E_S ###SpeakerB3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA4 . ###Probably the most popular one but , uh , one that *T*-1 is not typically recognized *-2 as such is the Boy Scouts . E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA6 . ###Uh , I know that \[ f- , \+ \] because my son is \[ a , \+ a \] scout now and , uh , is thinking about his Eagle E_S ###and , uh , in order * to get Eagle , you have *-1 to have merit badges in , uh , citizenship in the community citizenship in the nation , citizenship in the world E_S 
169020:39	###and , uh , in order * to get Eagle , you have *-1 to have merit badges in , uh , citizenship in the community citizenship in the nation , citizenship in the world E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA8 . ###and you have *-1 to do a public service project . Uh , in which leadership is the key element *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB9 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA10 . ###\[ I , \+ uh , I \] think 0 the question is posed *-1 somewhat strangely because , uh , it 's talking about a requirement for public service E_S ###SpeakerB11 . 
169025:47	###SpeakerB9 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA10 . ###\[ I , \+ uh , I \] think 0 the question is posed *-1 somewhat strangely because , uh , it 's talking about a requirement for public service E_S ###SpeakerB11 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###and , of course , \[ Pe- , \+ the Peace \] Corps , the Boy Scouts \[ is a , o- , \+ is a \] voluntary activity . E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###Right . E_S 
169043:24	###SpeakerB17 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###And , so , uh , one of the things that *T*-1 would fulfill \[ the , \+ at least the \] nominal , uh , qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft . E_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###Huh . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerA20 . 
169048:91	###SpeakerB19 . ###Huh . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###Uh , E_S ###but I agree with you , ###that probably is not what *T*-1 was comprehended *-2 . E_S ###There are other things such as civil service uh , which many people , uh , are lifelong employees of *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerB21 . 
169105:19	###SpeakerA38 . ###Oh , no , E_S ###no , E_S ###no . E_S ###It 's * to defend the nation against external evils . E_S ###SpeakerB39 . ###Well , that 's one view . E_S ###\[ \[ And , \+ and , \] \+ you know , and \] \[ that , \+ that 's \] another debate . E_S ###But , uh , it 's , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA40 . 
169133:14	###Uh , I know that there 's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh , that *ICH*-1 's kind of gone up in scale \[ and , \+ and \] some other things . E_S ###Uh , I personally had a little experience the other day . E_S ###Uh , somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Oh , really . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . 
169148:30	###so . N_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###What part of California are you from *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###San Jose , California . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Oh , really ? E_S ###I have a good friend there . E_S 
169210:32	###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###and then the houses were left *-1 unguarded *-2 , ###uh , E_S but yeah , E_S ###I think 0 given that people are pretty conscientious about it , N_S that 's a good way 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] work it *T*-1 , with a neighborhood watch . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###SpeakerA35 . 
169221:51	###SpeakerB36 . ###Oh , is that right ? E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###A high percentage of , uh , free time , N_S ###I think 0 it 's like fifty percent of most people 's free time is , uh , spent *T*-1 * doing yard work outdoors . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###So they wait while you 're \[ out , \+ outdoors . \] E_S ###They know 0 the house is unlocked E_S 
169226:42	###SpeakerB38 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###So they wait while you 're \[ out , \+ outdoors . \] E_S ###They know 0 the house is unlocked E_S ###and then they just slip in . ###* Slip in , slip out , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###That 's amazing . E_S ###SpeakerA41 .

E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###So , I 've heard 0 that 's really on the rise as far as uh , you know , a new type of crime . E_S 
169331:37	###SpeakerA81 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###it *EXP*-1 's against the law * to do a lot of things , you know . E_S ###They could basically , uh , N_S ###when I was getting robbed *-1 down in Florida *T*-2 , I was really considering *-3 electrifying doors um , things like that like E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###That 's , N_S ###SpeakerB84 . 
169408:39	###what am I trying *-1 to say *T*-2 . Uh , N_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###SpeakerA11 . ###I do learn about things . Largely from friends E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###and I occasionally will read something like the NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS . E_S ###You know , someone will write a book about something E_S 
169440:24	###And the view that I would rather take *T*-1 is that there 's a different amount of information 0 you need *T*-2 when you 're particularly interested in a topic or , uh , particularly interested in *-7 buying something \[ as a , \+ you know as a \] hobbyist *T*-5 versus when you want *-3 to go out and buy a blender because you need *-4 to mix things *T*-6 . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###SpeakerA25 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###SpeakerA27 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . 
169451:20	###If you want *-1 to just have an idea as to what *T*-2 's going on , most papers , \[ a- , \+ and \] especially the better papers , \[ the , \+ the \] TIMES , the WALL STREET JOURNAL , the WASHINGTON POST give you a reasonable idea . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###SpeakerA31 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###If you were deeply involved in it , then you immediately realize that what they print *T*-1 is stuff that you probably knew *T*-5 already and the stuff that you want *T*-2 they 're not printing *T*-4 because the average person does n't need or want *-3 to know that much . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Right . E_S 
169459:130	###SpeakerA33 . ###Right . E_S ###* Does n't want , N_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###SpeakerA35 . ###* Let me ask , by the way , just for the record . E_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ I 'm , \] \+ I \] totally concede that intelligent people read these things and intelligent people write them . E_S ###So , I mean , I 'm not being elitist in that sense , I hope 0 *T*-1 . Uh , E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Well , I mean , \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] a reasonable question as to whether it 's worth the amount of time 0 it takes *T*-1 * to keep up on things . E_S 
169577:27	###and \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 that 's probably all right in that they , you know , maybe know what \[ the , \+ the \] norm *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 for a particular thing . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###SpeakerB18 . ###And , I guess , also what the system will absorb *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Probably more tuned in to that . E_S 
169656:8	###they got the death penalty , E_S ###they should have one year and one appeal .

E_S ###I think 0 this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###that , N_S 
169741:13	###SpeakerA83 . ###Oh really ? E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Yeah . E_S ###So she follows that stuff pretty closely . E_S ###But , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###That 's interesting . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah , E_S 
169851:18	###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###And if you could show that , N_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] interviewed for a job recently E_S ###and I was taking Entex . ###And my doctor gave me a prescription for it . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA23 .

169978:39	###SpeakerB15 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###and we go there , uh , once a year .

E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . 
170201:43	###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###And I figure 0 that gives me room for the mistakes 0 I make *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###The , uh , N_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ i- , \] \+ I \] have *-1 to say that , E_S ###* let 's see , ###at this point on , I do n't run out of money . E_S 
170348:4	###but I mean the company as a whole N_S ###because you as an employee , ###even the company is making money , E_S ###they paying you a salary E_S ###but you are responsible for that company growth .

E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . 
170465:12	###and so she is sort of like an only child E_S ###and it 's the same type of thing , uh , E_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###I have a younger brother like that .

E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Well I think that currently the way 0 the law stands *T*-1 is n't so much that the laws are enforceable or not , E_S ###it 's more 0 they 're not enforcing the death penalty itself . E_S ###It 's at that point where they 're saying like here \[ you 're , \+ you 're \] going on death row *T*-1 E_S ###but you 'll stay there for twenty years . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . 
173592:33	###it 's more 0 they 're not enforcing the death penalty itself . E_S ###It 's at that point where they 're saying like here \[ you 're , \+ you 're \] going on death row *T*-1 E_S ###but you 'll stay there for twenty years . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###And nothing is being done *-1 about it . E_S ###Uh , the laws exist and MUMBLEx are frequently upheld *-3 \[ \[ in , \+ in , \] \+ uh , in \] Appeals Court just because of technicalities and because of maybe small little holes that their defending attorney can find *T*-2 . E_S ###And \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] really getting out of hand MUMBLEx in many states . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . 
173610:58	###\[ but , \+ but , \] you know , \[ the , \+ the \] merits of the case in terms of , you know , 0 the guy was a law breaker , as * being supportive . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###SpeakerA19 . ###Now , \[ I , \+ I 'm , \] \[ \[ a- , \+ a- , \] \+ at \] this juncture E_S ###\[ I , \+ you know , \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] \] not sure , you know , what *T*-1 constitutes \[ a , \+ a \] technicality . E_S ###You know , \[ that , \+ that 's \] what all \[ c- , \+ \] \[ these , \+ these \] hearings are about *T*-1 E_S ###and that 's what all these , you know , court cases are about *T*-1 . E_S ###I mean \[ \[ our , \+ uh , our , \] \+ our \] glorious , uh , you know , mayor here in Washington is six days away from *-1 getting \[ out of , \+ out of \] the can E_S ###and , uh , you know , \[ he , \+ he \] tried *-1 to appeal his conviction . ###Uh , E_S and , you know , it did n't work . E_S 
173618:77	###and , uh , you know , \[ he , \+ he \] tried *-1 to appeal his conviction . ###Uh , E_S and , you know , it did n't work . E_S ###But be that as it may *?* , everybody who *T*-1 got enough money will pump the appeal process dry . E_S ###Uh , \[ in , \+ in \] the old days , you know , and say round about times of battle of Hastings , you know , and the villages if you were a transgressor , \[ they , \+ they \] either , you know , drove you out in the woods ###or you became a ward of somebody E_S ###and \[ he , \+ you \] were his slave . E_S ###And if he did n't like what you did *T*-1 , he killed you . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . ###And \[ that has , \+ that 's \] pretty effective . E_S 
173635:25	###Um , for instance , um there 's a case *ICH*-2 a few years back where , uh , \[ someone , \+ uh , someone \] who *T*-3 's \[ \[ being convicted * for , \+ was under a tri- , \] \+ was going to trial for \] murder , was let *-1 off because of a technicality in that . \[ The of- , \+ the arresting officer , \] uh , did not read the defendant their rights *T*-4 . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###And where his , old evidence was there , the witnesses were there , \[ the , \+ \] everything was conclusively pointing to this individual *T*-1 yet , N_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###SpeakerB26 . ###SpeakerA1 . ###Uh , a lot of companies now \[ are , \+ are \] using , uh , drug testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations * \[ to , \+ to \] root out \[ the , \+ the \] either , uh , elementary or intermediate or advanced , uh , drug users . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . 
173683:60	###Uh , and I guess 0 part of the reason there is because of the fact that , uh , things like drug laws seem *-1 to come and go . E_S ###You know , we had prohibition for awhile E_S ###and then we did n't have prohibition . E_S ###Uh , you know , we 've had , I guess 0 *T*-1 , laws against , uh , you know , various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years , I guess . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Maybe a little longer . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Well I think 0 , uh , \[ \[ the dr- , \+ the laws on , \] \+ uh , uh , uh , the first morphine laws \] \[ were , \+ were \] like ninety , or nineteen ten or nineteen five , something like that . E_S 
173737:35	###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###well that 's why there 's , you know , people dealing it because there 's money in it *T*-1 , you know . E_S ###There 's ridiculous amounts of money . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###But \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I , \] \+ I \] think \[ \[ that , \+ that the , \] \+ that , \] you know , \[ the , \+ \] *-1 being in law enforcement , you know , \[ \[ \[ \[ \[ th- , \+ th- , \] \+ th- , \] \+ they , \] \+ I , \] \+ I \] probably have a kind of a draconian , Philistine attitude toward it .

173761:34	###I mean that 's a losing fight . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ \[ A- , \+ a- , \] \+ as \] soon as we wind up , uh , uh , you know , for , N_S ###well if we can just destroy the market by * destroying the demand N_S ###\[ but , \+ but \] people want *-1 to , \[ get , \+ get \] stoned E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . 
173816:4	###And , uh , they , uh , take an \[ active , \+ relatively active \] part . E_S ###\[ Which , \+ \] uh , I mean if you 're , uh , sending two thousand dollars that way every year , you , uh , watch what *T*-1 goes on ###and you , uh , uh , pay attention and participate E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] you can influence the way 0 things are *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###So you 're saying that the taxpayer who *T*-1 also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of , uh , real estate or other taxes E_S ###\[ and , \+ and , \] consequently , they 're not so motivated *-1 to get involved *-2 and make * sure 0 things happen the way 0 they 'd like *-3 to see them happen *T*-4 ? E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Yeah . E_S ###The immediacy just is n't there . E_S 
173832:22	###And , I guess 0 my evidence for that is the school districts in places like California , for example , where only a minority of the taxpayers have children in school *T*-1 E_S ###and you ca n't get a tax levy passed *-1 . E_S ###Uh , people are , uh , reluctant *-1 to pass , uh , school tax levies even , uh , when the money is needed *-3 or would be well spent *T*-2 because \[ it 's , \+ \] uh , they do n't have kids in the schools . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###I think 0 that 's \[ a , \+ a \] loss of civic virtue and a loss of , uh , uh , the cultural attitude that we used *-1 to have *T*-2 that education was first even if it was n't our kids . E_S ###I think 0 \[ that 's , \+ uh , that 's \] the principal problem is that , uh , people no longer see it \[ as , \+ uh , as \] their problem E_S ###and there 's an immediate problem . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . 
173840:49	###and there 's an immediate problem . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Right . E_S ###It *EXP*-2 troubles me too \[ tha- , \+ that \] the priority seems *-1 to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good E_S ###and by definition , for some of us , at least , the public good includes * having an educated populace and then idea that , uh , you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes \[ in the , \+ at the \] local level or bigger votes at the national level . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S 
173844:41	###and by definition , for some of us , at least , the public good includes * having an educated populace and then idea that , uh , you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes \[ in the , \+ at the \] local level or bigger votes at the national level . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh , it means that you 've got *-1 to be informed E_S ###and you 've got *-1 to have a certain level of education *-2 to do the reading and the critical thinking involved * *-3 to come up with a decision . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . 
173845:40	###SpeakerA15 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah . E_S 
173884:83	###And , uh , I 'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is *T*-1 . E_S ###And I 'm really sad *-1 to say this , E_S ###I never thought 0 I would have *?* E_S ###but I really think that , uh , the educational establishment has become part of the problem . E_S ###And , uh , that 's why I guess I 'm sort of , reluctantly , uh , in favor of these , uh , choice programs *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Right . E_S ###Well \[ I , \+ I \] \[ g- , \+ \] agree with everything that you 've said *T*-1 so far E_S ###and the only that I 'd want *-1 to add *T*-2 is that I 'm a little more in contact , I think , with public school teachers than perhaps you are *?* , uh , except as a parent of your child E_S ###and the sense that I get *T*-1 from public school teachers that I know *T*-2 is that they are very conscious of what they feel 0 they should be doing *T*-3 E_S

174017:10	###things like that where they 're not really missing the presence , you know *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA50 . ###Right .

174331:33	###It 's , N_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's not . E_S ###And then you get people \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-1 bring in cases just because they want *-2 to bring them up just because . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Yep . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Like \[ this , \+ this \] friend of mine 's pretty obnoxious E_S ###and he really gets into *-1 suing people . E_S

174549:8	###SpeakerA47 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###SpeakerA49 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###And they want *-1 to do the research E_S ###and uh , they 're all you know , nor- , N_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Yeah . E_S 
174650:4	###Texas , I saw on T V the other night 0 *T*-1 , \[ is the , \+ has had \] forty-six in like the past several years . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###So they 're pretty hip on it too , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###They do it by lethal injection , at Huntsville . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Yeah , E_S ###okay . E_S ###I think 0 Florida still uses electric chair . E_S 
174688:18	###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###Sure . E_S ###And \[ it 's \+ like , \+ you know , that 's \] a big problem E_S ###but there 's not a whole lot 0 you can do *T*-1 about it because there 's only so many jails 0 you can build *T*-2 E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . 
174745:58	###SpeakerB50 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Uh , * kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###What do you do *T*-1 Georgeanne ? E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###I 'm a graduate student at the University of Texas in Dallas . E_S ###SpeakerB54 .

174851:24	###SpeakerA1 . ###So how do you feel *T*-1 about it ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Uh , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't see any problem \[ with , \+ with \] * testing for random drugs . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I , \] myself , almost , uh , am in favor of it .

E_S ###SpeakerB4 . 
174889:65	###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###But i- , N_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Yeah . E_S ###And \[ that , \+ that \] definitely happens , you know . E_S 
174906:6	###They are n't that sensitive . E_S ###Like if you 're on a prescription drug of some kind , you know , what are they going *-1 to do *T*-2 about that . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###You know , I was on a couple of different prescription drugs when I was tested *-1 for Honeywell *T*-2 E_S ###and , uh , uh , you know , I know 0 they did n't catch that ###or else they would have said something . E_S ###Uh , I 'm sure 0 they screen for just a particular few types . E_S ###Although the literature 0 they give *T*-1 with you says yeah we do this E_S 
175018:42	###but they do n't do it . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###You know , so . That 's good I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###I do n't know . E_S ###I mean , \[ I , \+ uh , I \] have gone to a couple of parties \[ since , \+ since \] that time E_S ###and while I do n't do any drugs myself , I 've seen some people who *T*-1 work there , uh , you know , smoking a joint or whatever . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
175048:28	###but , uh , we 're toward the bottom . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###And , uh , there 's a lot of things that I see *T*-1 that *T*-2 are so obviously wrong . That you would think 0 it would be easy 0 * to correct *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###SpeakerA9 . ###Right . E_S 
175060:8	###SpeakerA11 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###How about you ? E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Well , that 's interesting . E_S ###I have a sister who *T*-1 used *-2 to live in Kennesaw , Georgia . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Oh , yes . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . 
175078:8	###SpeakerA19 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###She was in Cobb County . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Right . E_S ###I 'm , N_S ###I ca n't really say much about the schools up here . E_S ###I really do n't come from here E_S ###SpeakerB22 . 
175295:11	###and that 's why jury selection is often very difficult *T*-1 . Uh . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Well , \[ I , \+ I \] feel the other thing too , uh , E_S ###they were saying , uh , you know , what new ways \[ could y- , \+ could it , \] \[ you , \+ you \] know , change the system *T*-1 . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] really think that , uh , we spend a lot of time , uh , *-1 going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal , E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###SpeakerA17 . ###I mean , \[ i- , \+ if \] you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed .

175296:19	###SpeakerA15 . ###Well , \[ I , \+ I \] feel the other thing too , uh , E_S ###they were saying , uh , you know , what new ways \[ could y- , \+ could it , \] \[ you , \+ you \] know , change the system *T*-1 .

175336:18	###SpeakerB34 . ###Well \[ plea bar- , \+ plea bargaining \] is a different story . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Well . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Plea bargaining is something completely different .

E_S ###When you 're saying as far as the appeal , uh , procedure was concerned *-1 *T*-2 . E_S 
175414:10	###Uh , \[ a- , \+ \] like I said , as far as removing of the jury and * having the judge sentence , that 's absurd . E_S ###There 's no way 0 that could work *T*-1 .
