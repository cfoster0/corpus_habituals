337:4	money seems *-1 to be too big of an issue . \[ \[ \[ With , \+ with , \] \+ with , \] \+ with \] what *T*-2 's going on today E_S
496:6	their attire is always the same , you know .
583:4	everybody does n't have cabin fever today . E_S
668:78	and \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] tend *-1 to , I think 0 *T*-3 , overreact occasionally when somebody tells me 0 it 's that great *T*-2 . E_S
669:38	\[ And , \+ and \] \[ it was , \+ the thing is , 0 \[ it was , \+ it was \] \] a good story . E_S
755:135	\[ the , \+ the \] difficulty \[ with , \+ with \] DANCING WITH WOLVES is that when you make a movie like that *T*-2 , and you produce it *T*-2 , and then you star in it *T*-2 , uh , the question is , \[ did he , \+ did he \] really know 0 it was going *-1 to be good E_S
780:22	I do n't know who that guy is *T*-1 . E_S
850:23	but it says 0 when the conversation is over *T*-1 * just say your good-byes and hang up . E_S
861:84	Well , the first thing for me is \[ I wonder , \+ I see \] a couple of different ways of * talking about what privacy is *T*-1 ,
862:18	um , if \[ privacy is something that *T*-2 disturbs your private state , \+ I mean an invasion of privacy is something that *T*-3 disturbs your private state , \] E_S that 's one thing , E_S
862:68	um , if \[ privacy is something that *T*-2 disturbs your private state , \+ I mean an invasion of privacy is something that *T*-3 disturbs your private state , \] E_S that 's one thing , E_S
863:10	and if privacy is something that *T*-1 comes into your private state and extracts information from it , in other words , finds something *ICH*-2 out about you that 's another . E_S
865:38	but in the second time , at least overtly , uh , where someone comes in and , uh , finds out information about you that *T*-1 should be private *T*-2 , uh , does not seem , uh , um , obviously , everyday . E_S
868:106	I think 0 in a good example on the typical thing that *T*-1 happens , uh , when the phone rang *T*-2 E_S and it 's T I 0 *T*-3 calling , E_S my immediate reaction is that it 's some sort of strange phone message E_S
937:99	Well , I guess , 0 although , \[ I , \+ \] well , that 's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is *T*-1 *T*-3 *T*-2 , because , uh , if that 's the case of a tree falling in the forest E_S
943:12	then maybe my privacy has n't been *?* because I have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded *-2 . E_S
962:10	and if someone finds out something about me that *T*-1 is true , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't have a sense of loss from that . E_S
1021:79	I mean , they said 0 they would give it out to only select companies E_S but , um , you know , just like software is only given *-1 out to customers , E_S
1033:68	and there 's something rather ominous about * having virtually anyone , any hacker being able *-1 to know what your income is *T*-2 , what your spending habits are *T*-3 , E_S
1038:56	And I guess 0 that turns out *-1 to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you 're feeling , threatened as a result \[ of , \+ of \] it E_S
1042:48	so , maybe that is \[ a , \+ a \] little bit of what privacy is *T*-1 . E_S
1059:36	In fact , it *EXP*-2 's said *-1 that no Indian language has a word for privacy , E_S
1095:20	Whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much *T*-1 , if you go out and then act like the lunatic \[ you , \+ you \] violate \[ the , \+ uh , the \] norms \[ of social , \+ of , um , public \] behavior . E_S
1117:68	and \[ it 's obvious , \+ you know , the results of sex are quite obvious , \] , as the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years . E_S
1144:8	but no one is just welcome *-1 to come by my house . E_S
1162:53	and invariably just about the time , 0 I 'm going *-1 to sleep *T*-2 , the phone tears off the wall . E_S
1261:35	Now the part about where you said 0 the apartment complex puts up signs that *T*-1 says no soliciting *T*-2 , E_S
1586:21	you know , when that subject comes up *T*-1 they can say yes , E_S
1823:100	And , \[ he , \+ he \] since then \[ has , \+ has \] amended that , and paid them his royalties every time 0 \[ the , \+ the \] song goes on *T*-1 E_S
1967:11	Well , world music is , um , N_S
1995:6	world music takes the forms that *T*-1 have really been , um , N_S I guess , 0 I N_S you know , \[ the best example \+ or , you know , the cream of the crop , \] I guess 0 you could say , N_S
2069:11	because our house payment is once a month , E_S
2114:33	\[ if you ca n't stay , \+ if something comes up and you ca n't stay \] within it then we have , uh , you know , a budget for , you know , like 0 we call *T*-1 our slush fund or something E_S
2215:74	\[ that , \+ that 's \] the other financial thing 0 I guess that we 've done *T*-1 is with our life insurance is , since I 'm at home now \[ is , \+ is \] * figuring out , uh , what we would need *T*-2 if something happened to my husband , or what he would need *T*-3 if something happened to me , E_S
2312:28	It talks about , uh , who the customer is *T*-1 and * being customer oriented , uh , which *T*-2 falls in line with the T I culture here at Texas Instruments . E_S
2320:50	Uh , so that 's all in self improvement * to stay focused on who the customer is *T*-1 E_S
2399:28	but , uh , I think 0 sometimes the word is a little over used E_S
2444:11	and supposedly the policy is like , you know , \[ we , \+ you know , we , \] hire these wonderful creative people E_S
2511:31	and , you know , this area where record retention is *T*-1 , there 's only a few people that *T*-2 work there , E_S
2560:6	and nobody says anything to them . E_S
2566:6	the management does n't ever seem *-1 to want *-2 to take an , cut off , you know , that no , E_S this is wear we 're going *-3 to draw the line *T*-4 . E_S
2598:26	Well I think 0 T I 's dress code is pretty lax * considering everything , anyway , you know , uh . E_S
2600:41	\[ I know , \+ I did n't know \] that E D S has a very strict dress code , E_S
2635:10	and E D S is very particular about this , hair cuts , E_S
2696:152	And sometimes I wonder if stuff like that \[ would , \+ will \] hold you back , you know , if you do n't dress in , you know , your * dress for success business suits everyday \[ if , \+ you know , if \] upper management does n't notice that and remember that later on , E_S
2751:20	I wonder what kind of money does he make *T*-1 , E_S
2824:15	and our yard work , everything is in bloom , E_S
2825:10	so our yard work is pretty tough , the ground being dry , E_S
2909:76	It 's amazing to me E_S because I have only lived in Dallas for three years , E_S and I can not believe that the wind blows all the time . E_S
3268:33	and , what *T*-1 happens is like , oh , everybody gets like totally into the music E_S
3296:44	And , see , the difference , I guess , between hard rock and heavy metal is \[ that \+ \] the lyrics also . E_S
3303:13	And , just hard rock has , N_S
3383:8	the older stuff is the best of it . E_S
3452:32	And then , one of them said , well , everything is great , E_S
3456:28	Because \[ it 's \+ like , the end is , \] like , really depressing . E_S
3461:43	\[ \[ But it , \+ but it 's \] \+ like the movie is \] so well made , E_S
3667:60	and , uh , you know , whenever \[ \[ we , \+ he , \] \+ my \] husband has time off or something *T*-1 , we take them to the zoo , E_S
3681:44	\[ an , \+ an \] then , uh , you know , my husband enjoys *-1 spending time with the kids , you know , E_S
3724:15	Especially since my youngest one is , * excuse me , only fourteen months . E_S
3782:32	the thing that *T*-2 sticks out most in my mind is \[ that , \+ \] like a kid 's place area . E_S
3835:37	\[ And , \+ and \] you said 0 about Plano and Campbell is *T*-1 the petting , E_S
3845:15	and the one in Mesquite is , uh , Scyene exit . E_S
3901:8	my favorite show is MASTERPIECE THEATRE E_S
3945:88	Well , unfortunately for us at least here in the United States , \[ we , \+ the only access *ICH*-2 0 we \] have *T*-1 to that of course is public television . E_S
4034:14	I mean the man is sixty-two years old . E_S
4246:31	well , uh , \[ my , \+ my \] husband is right now teaching an aerobics class . E_S
4298:23	that 's the way 0 my mother stands on it *T*-1 . E_S
4449:12	but , the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere *T*-1 . E_S
4477:76	And , uh , oh \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] \[ uni- , \+ University \] of California at Berkeley puts out THE WELLNESS LETTER . Which *T*-1 \[ is , \+ \] uh , turned into a fairly well subscribed to , uh , newsletter , monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that E_S
4586:17	and an awful lot of exercise is sort of image conscious . E_S
4715:17	You know where Saint Joe is *T*-1 ? E_S
4750:4	murder is nothing to them , you know . E_S
4854:4	Turkey has the death penalty , for just about everything . E_S
4898:20	Because that 's what our society becomes *T*-1 . E_S
5013:20	But , you know , her preference is *-1 to be in an office situation where her job is ... N_S
5013:54	But , you know , her preference is *-1 to be in an office situation where her job is ... N_S
5035:6	My husband is even interested in it now . E_S
5301:6	The topic is * to discuss the , uh , sources where I receive news *T*-1 . E_S
5352:23	And they were saying that C N N is definitely a world , uh , news service E_S
5394:6	local news concentrates , on murders and things like that . E_S
5541:6	My name is Nick . E_S
5558:6	What time is it *T*-1 over th- , E_S
5666:57	\[ \[ It , \+ it 's , \] \+ it 's \] a lot bigger than Monterey is *?* . E_S
5765:20	But , I mean , the guy is still in . E_S
5857:33	\[ I , \+ I \] mean , I B M is like , N_S
5864:14	And so , I B M says well \[ we have , \+ we have \] *-1 to have a team ,
5887:53	but , you know , it 's like \[ * only use \+ \] like one person does the work E_S
5928:35	And then this guy from \[ Federal , \+ Federal \] Express comes along . E_S
5931:25	and they can tell you where your package is *T*-1 anywhere , any time . E_S
5938:35	But , see , uh , \[ the , \+ the \] thing is , that I B M is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff . E_S
5938:51	But , see , uh , \[ the , \+ the \] thing is , that I B M is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff . E_S
5956:11	Well I B M does n't fire anybody . E_S Because uh , what they do *T*-1 is \[ they , \+ they \] put you in a different job . Which \[ y- , \+ you \] actually are like sitting around not doing anything *T*-2 . E_S
5985:19	It 's like how much paper is *T*-1 going in ? E_S
6010:6	My dad works for them E_S
6067:8	I B M says * let 's throw it away . E_S
6079:42	They buy \[ all , \+ all \] the things that I B M throws *T*-1 away E_S
6211:25	But as I grow older and my family grows , \[ it , \+ the medical benefits \] are more important E_S
6212:8	and the retirement is more important . E_S
6437:6	the money is actually coming out of your own pocket , E_S
6480:55	\[ and , \+ and \] a lot of that is left *-1 up to whoever your supervisor happens *-2 to be *T*-4 and what type of relationship *ICH*-5 you have *T*-3 with that person E_S
6551:45	\[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] know how the Peace Corps works *T*-1 , E_S
6805:6	My daughter-in-law is Panamanian , you know , E_S
6883:8	and the church helps them out some , E_S
6991:6	My husband does at work just *-1 to get cash out , E_S
7033:6	The idea is * to use their money . E_S
7069:14	Everybody in the country is preapproved , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
7117:46	It *EXP*-1 's enjoyable * \[ talking with , \+ seeing \] that somebody feels the same way , E_S
7135:17	and hobbies in our spare time is what we 've been selected *-1 to discuss *T*-2 today . E_S
7145:8	so the time goes by , you know , before you realize 0 anything is going on . E_S
7192:6	My wife hates it , E_S
7193:24	but that 's the way 0 life is *T*-2 , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S
7498:50	I 'm always amazed \[ at \+ \] \[ that , \+ that \] each candidate thinks 0 it 's going *-1 to be the people that *T*-2 come out that *T*-3 will vote for him , you know . E_S
7511:25	\[ when , \+ when \] abortion comes on the issues *T*-1 and people just get all \[ insp- , \+ inspired , \] you know , N_S
7516:8	this particular community is a Catholic community E_S
7531:68	I can understand \[ why , \+ why \] some of \[ the , \+ the \] rural areas , the voter turnout is n't as much because it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in D C are like controlling things for \[ the , \+ the \] Midwest *T*-1 , E_S
7588:22	But , I know , 0 my grandmother has n't voted in years . E_S
7597:11	Well , the majority believes this way E_S
7682:8	Central Standard Time is what they 're doing it by *T*-1 . E_S
7983:14	I mean , somebody walks in \[ the , \+ a \] classroom E_S
8062:23	We do n't even know where one is *T*-1 . E_S
8351:19	Well , in my case my husband is not a carpenter , E_S
8425:6	First one is always a bear . E_S
8504:160	but the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that , um , I have *-1 to keep it under control because , for example , you know , it 's like \[ the , \+ the \] beginning of the semester when you go *-2 to pay for everything *T*-3 , everything is pretty rough , E_S
8507:22	it 's like , once the semester starts I 'm the one who *T*-1 has *-2 to control how much spending there is *T*-3 . E_S
8518:63	So , uh , what *T*-1 happens is 0 you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts . E_S
8522:11	And then the tuition is also the same thing . E_S
8547:10	so all the money comes from home . E_S
8602:11	basically the United States is the cheapest country 0 * to call out of *T*-1 . E_S
8714:25	You know , that 's when everybody goes crazy on * charging stuff *T*-1 . E_S
8726:50	like , like , uh , \[ for Chr- , \+ uh , for Christmas \] my roommate goes , what do you want *T*-1 . E_S
8757:15	but , um , the thing is , * especially remember when I was down in Argentina *T*-1
8875:8	and the wife gets kind of aggravated about that , E_S
8914:8	And my husband says 0 I do it , you know , make afghans so I can keep my lap warm . E_S
8916:27	Well , that 's kind of what my wife says *T*-1 . E_S
8950:24	first thing that *T*-1 comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because she starts and goes all the way across , you know , back and forth until she winds up with this big piece \[ of , \+ of \] afghan . E_S
8965:8	And my husband says 0 that 's called *-1 rinky-dink . E_S
9003:16	nobody else in the family likes them , E_S
9007:11	oh , my husband does n't like them either , E_S
9024:13	Supposedly after the soil warms up . E_S
9041:39	Probably the same time 0 \[ the , \+ the \] other squash is *T*-1 though . E_S
9147:6	the information is one of those wire services kind of \[ news , \+ pieces of news , \] you know , E_S
9236:8	Well nobody wants *-1 to pay twenty-five cents a kilowatt hour , I do n't think 0 *T*-2 . E_S
9249:11	and yet the government is not going *-1 to do that because people are too dependent E_S
9407:33	do \[ you , \+ you \] think 0 San Antonio is more comfortable than Dallas . E_S
9438:4	Orlando is the only place 0 I 've ever been *T*-1 where I 've seen the car sweat *T*-2 . E_S
9481:34	well I guess 0 \[ this , \+ the \] weather is n't as lively a topic \[ as , \+ uh , as \] some of the others 0 we might have gotten *T*-1 . E_S
9490:6	my daughter is here *-1 prodding me to say good-bye . E_S
9512:27	well , my favorite , probably , all time T V show is STAR TREK . E_S
9569:32	And , uh , \[ h- , \+ his \] big thing is that he can take \[ pieces of , \+ little bits \] and pieces of string and baling wire and turn them into fantastic different things . E_S
9646:8	But SESAME STREET is still really good . E_S
9663:6	that one tends *-1 to come on earlier in the day than I want *-2 to turn the T V on . E_S
9667:6	SESAME STREET comes on from like nine to ten , which *T*-1 is a good time E_S
9668:6	and everybody is up and had breakfast and dressed and ready *-1 to go , E_S
10172:19	Apparently I think 0 his contract is up after the end of this year E_S
10326:6	my boss thinks 0 I 'm absolutely crazy . E_S
10369:6	And Lord knows what *T*-1 happened to him . E_S
10637:4	Precious is a medium hair yellow cat , E_S
10642:6	and Rascal is a black and white short hair . E_S
10668:22	I mean it 's like nobody messes with her mamma . E_S
10687:23	I mean , oh , if something happens to her . E_S
10701:6	My mother has dogs E_S
10713:19	I 'm so glad my husband is a cat person because if he was a dog person , no , it would n't have worked . E_S
10767:15	that 's how life goes *T*-1 . E_S
10925:6	and everyone feels 0 they are totally retarded . E_S
11012:29	* Just think of what a phenomenal actor Dustin Hoffman is *T*-1 . E_S
11051:6	Our community does n't really have any organized recycling drive . E_S
11165:48	And I 'm sure that the , uh , driving factor for * recycling the computer paper is that we get paid *-1 *-1 to do so . E_S
11267:26	and the real sturdy boxes that copy room paper comes in *T*-1 , with the nice lids . Those get thrown *-2 away . E_S
11471:26	\[ the , \+ uh , the \] show is about these , uh , catatonic type people that , N_S
11472:6	this doctor discovers a drug that *T*-1 brings them back to \[ the , \+ the \] living , more or less , E_S
11798:21	I think 0 probably the greatest cause is , uh , vehicles , especially around cities . E_S
11826:6	and Attleboro sits in just over the line , where T I 's plant is *T*-1 , E_S
11826:41	and Attleboro sits in just over the line , where T I 's plant is *T*-1 , E_S
11855:41	one of \[ our , \+ our \] biggest electrical plants in Rhode Island uses coal *-1 to , uh , generate electricity . E_S
11863:21	I notice 0 locally a major problem is Kodak . E_S
12042:35	but \[ that \+ at least , that \] kind of particulate comes out of the air pretty quickly . E_S
12047:6	This country seems *-1 to be a little behind on that . E_S
12207:18	And I catered to their diet is the only thing , though , E_S
12294:16	so I think 0 dessert is the only thing that I kind of down play *T*-1 , sometimes . E_S
12318:9	Um , nothing comes to mind right off , E_S
12386:26	And \[ if , \+ if \] my memory serves me right , I believe 0 a majority of Democrats may even have opposed it , E_S
12457:9	Well , Baker is really not very much pro Israel . E_S
12462:20	And did you know 0 John Sununu is , uh , half Arab ? E_S
12514:42	however , uh , every time 0 an organization such as the P L O says well we 'll see if we can work with Israel *T*-1 , then , uh , they get embarrassed *ICH*-2 \[ some , \+ \] every few months by documents that *T*-3 reveal that their ultimate purpose is * to totally eliminate them . E_S

12525:40	and I think 0 that 's the problem 0 the P L O has *T*-1 is that \[ when they , \+ whenever one group of them \] decides that they 're going *-2 to negotiate , or they 're going *-3 to do something , they 're going *-4 to try *-5 to make some peace *T*-6 , \[ but , \+ \] uh , the end result is that \[ they , \+ there \] so many factions of them \[ and , \+ \] uh , some more violent than others , some with a certain agenda different than the others , or they split , E_S

12734:53	I guess 0 the closest 0 I 've ever come *T*-1 to * participating in music is * singing in the choir . E_S
12912:6	my husband likes , uh , country music real well E_S
12962:36	I guess 0 probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is , uh , probably Eddy Arnold . E_S
13047:11	Well , the problem is 0 most of the record players now will not play them because , you have *-1 to have \[ that needle , \+ that , uh , particular kind of needle \] E_S
13140:8	and the radio is , you know , more exciting *ICH*-1 , really , \[ than , \+ than \] television , E_S
13150:27	it just did n't vegetate your mind like television does . E_S
13393:9	Now the address is the same
13465:15	and , uh , my daughter gets irate , \[ when I , \+ when I \] do that *T*-1 because , you know , she 's a teenager E_S
13500:13	and , uh , phone rings like crazy E_S
13555:7	well Tigon is part of G T E . E_S
13644:54	Uh , now I think 0 the change that I 've seen *T*-1 as much as anything is one where couples , uh , are more carefully planning their intention on how *-3 to both share homemaking duties *T*-4 and also how women will , uh , have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place *T*-6 *T*-5 *T*-2 . E_S
13679:29	\[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 one knows one 's own storly E_S
13737:43	Uh , \[ I know \[ that , \+ that \] \+ my sense is that \] I have very much an interest *RNR*-2 and had one *RNR*-2 in *-1 being a parent . E_S
13749:32	Maybe we 'll see a growth in that where someone makes a career out of , say , *-1 taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care *T*-2 . E_S
14073:19	I do n't think 0 radio is as bad *-1 to do that as T V is *?* . E_S
14073:50	I do n't think 0 radio is as bad *-1 to do that as T V is *?* . E_S
14075:4	Radio seems *-3 to have a full platter or full plate of different things that they need *-1 to get *T*-2 done . E_S
14083:22	I do n't know which that answer is *T*-1 . E_S
14164:92	but \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 it helps me everyday in *-1 trying *-2 to review \[ wh- , \+ \] the state that the world is in *T*-3 and try *-2 to guess where we 're going *T*-4 . E_S
14168:43	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] think , uh , 0 my background is probably what *T*-1 absolutely turned me off with SIXTY MINUTES . E_S
14283:50	Well I mean , you know , I think , uh , 0 once Jimmy Johnson gets his system established *-1 , uh , they 'll do all right . E_S
14291:53	So , \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] even know who your favorite team is *T*-1 , actually . E_S
14548:16	and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level , E_S
14607:10	so . My name is Fernando . E_S
14625:8	but his wife has a contract with T I , E_S
14712:13	And , uh , somebody walks in there with a gun . E_S
14763:11	see , their theory is that if I 'm surrounded *-5 , and I 'm going *-1 to be caught *-2 , I 'm going *-3 to try *-4 to find my way through , E_S
14783:6	one person does n't know the other person down the line . E_S
14795:8	and this guy comes over , E_S
14823:16	in one part , the guy goes out of jail , E_S
15134:23	But \[ that , \+ that \] time is minuscule compared to \[ what , \+ what , \] MUMBLEx they were referring to *T*-1 . E_S
15412:6	the length is n't too long ? E_S
15922:4	life is so much more enjoyable . E_S

16264:46	a lot \[ of , \+ um , of \] a , um , winter produce comes from South America . E_S
16337:15	And then before the milk gets too hot , um , I add two beaten eggs
16439:6	the trick is * to get the cornstarch , E_S
16466:12	Because by the vanilla does n't seem *-1 to thicken as well as the , N_S
16467:9	sometimes the cocoa is N_S
16484:15	And then once the pudding starts *-1 cooling it makes little balls of water on the Saran Wrap , E_S
16556:6	My truck is broken down . E_S
16651:22	And then even my eleven year old boy loves *-1 to listen to it . E_S
16654:91	I mean it 's nice when you have a piece \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 is \[ so , \+ so \] peaceful , that everybody likes *T*-2 *T*-3 , you know , E_S
16724:19	do you know who Chuck Mangione is *T*-1 ? E_S
16936:50	because \[ if that 's what , \+ if that 's what \] the punishment is *T*-2 \[ in that , \+ in that \] instance , then you 're always going *-1 to say , you know , not gui- , N_S
17086:6	my daughter has PRECIOUS MOMENTS collection E_S
17104:36	\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] about the hardest thing is , who *T*-1 's related to who . E_S
17187:13	Uh , his last name ends in a Z ,
17407:6	Nathaniel Hawthorne is pretty scary himself . E_S
17718:17	Well they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging . E_S
17745:37	But it 's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is *?* . E_S
17750:6	my treadmill has an incline E_S
17860:22	\[ and , \+ but \] the thing is 0 everybody always looks so good on that show , at least on MUMBLEx . N_S
17865:6	Not everybody has a picture perfect body . E_S
18104:6	and nothing happens . E_S
18106:47	And as far as the other states , I honestly do n't know what their capital punishment is *T*-1 . E_S
18112:36	\[ I think \+ I think \] 0 \[ Texas is wha- , \+ Texas , \] the southern states seem *-1 to be somewhat more conservative and still have the death penalty , E_S
18157:6	The victim is really , * seems like *T*-3 *ICH*-2 left *-1 out in the cold , more or less , does n't it , E_S
18168:95	Some of the things that * *EXP*-1 would make sense * \[ to , \+ to \] tell the jury *T*-2 , that \[ this , \+ this \] guy has \[ a , \+ a \] prior \[ cri- , \+ criminal \] history , you know , where he 's raped ten women *T*-3 N_S
18437:63	\[ and \+ \] but \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I 'm \] amazed because the sun is so intense , E_S
18448:8	and the backyard has two great big , uh , spruce \[ and , \+ and \] an oak tree all about forty to fifty foot tall E_S
18449:8	so the backyard is just complete dark all day long . E_S
18480:78	It just seems like \[ they , \+ \] \[ that , \+ that \] even , you know , * pruning once a year is really not enough E_S
18511:27	\[ But , \+ uh , but \] the rye does really well . Especially during the wintertime . E_S
18646:11	and just the air is so dry . E_S
18651:6	my father-in-law says 0 the mesquite trees are , \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] pretty smart , E_S
18866:27	once you get passed thirty-three megahertz , all help is , kind of lost *-1 \[ in the , \+ in the \] translation . Because you no longer can think that fast anyway . E_S
18900:6	Our community is , uh , just starting *-1 to get organized about it . E_S
18949:44	At my office , we have two big cardboard boxes in the library where everybody goes *T*-1 *-2 to pick up their mail , E_S
19006:62	And then \[ the , \+ uh , they \] take them to a special part of our dump where composting is now in full swing *T*-1 , E_S
19047:57	\[ And then the , \+ plus the \] time that you waste *T*-1 *-2 standing in line is valuable also . E_S
19082:8	and the thing is , 0 I hardly have room *ICH*-1 now for all the things that we 're saving *T*-2 it *-3 to recycle , E_S
19087:62	and \[ wi- , \+ \] there , right outside \[ the , \+ that \] place where the garbage can is *T*-1 we have the bag for the newspapers , E_S

19265:14	well , Gorbachev 's future is like
19285:6	the evidence is that , uh , you know , \[ he 's , \+ he 's \] let \[ some , \+ some \] stuff *ICH*-1 go , you know , the east German situation . E_S
19289:21	It 's just 0 the whole thing is so incomprehensible , E_S you know ,
19310:13	Uh , the U S is n't the threat that we 've always made them out *-2 to be *T*-1 , you know , even if they 're saying that beneath the doors . E_S
19318:108	Even if it is , you know , the best thing in the long run , it just steps on too many people *ICH*-3 's toes , who *T*-1 are comfortable with the way 0 the situation is *T*-2 . E_S
19473:63	and maybe , you know , more and more people are seeing , oh , countries hopefully are seeing that that buffer is n't going *-1 to help you , E_S
19475:34	well , I guess like , with , uh , 0 Israel is a perfect example . E_S
19479:75	The reason 0 they have the Angolan Heights *T*-1 and \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ \] uh , all their buffer area is between Jordan and \[ the , \+ the \] Sinai
19490:108	I knew a lot of guys in the service 0 when they were sent *-1 to Germany *T*-2 *T*-4 they said 0 that 's the safest place in the world because if a war starts , all the bombs are going *-3 to go right over Germany E_S
19512:4	Nobody knows what * to do *T*-1 . E_S
19762:6	My husband is always , you know , talked about \[ th- , \+ Texas \] being a , uh , rebel state . E_S
19862:8	or , God knows what . E_S
19901:42	And , uh , the SHADOW OF BLOOMING GROVE and TWO THOUSAND AND TEN and GRANT TAKES COMMAND and THE WAR IN THE YEAR ,
19955:14	I read the GRANT TAKES COMMAND , E_S
20170:36	Well , uh , \[ my , \+ uh , my \] family is from , uh , Europe \[ from , \+ well , from \] England and Ireland and , uh , have been in this country for , oh , more than a hundred and fifty years almost two hundred years , E_S
20215:4	Age is one , for example , E_S
20259:59	as far as the quality of the streets , the school systems , um , the hospital stuff that the government gives money to *T*-1 . Um , the , you know , all the things that the government does *T*-2 like that . \[ I , \+ uh , I \] think 0 they need *-3 to manage it a little bit better , E_S
20259:112	as far as the quality of the streets , the school systems , um , the hospital stuff that the government gives money to *T*-1 . Um , the , you know , all the things that the government does *T*-2 like that . \[ I , \+ uh , I \] think 0 they need *-3 to manage it a little bit better , E_S
20260:28	but I do n't think , uh , 0 anybody is just going *-1 to come in and fix it in a couple of weeks , because they 've been messing it up for many years , now . E_S
20280:8	and the county adds theirs , E_S
20509:10	though the note is thirty years , she said 0 it 's going *-1 be paid *-2 off in twenty or twenty one years , or something like that . E_S
20573:6	Credit union has nine percent interest . E_S
20745:11	and besides my daughter wants me to put her to bed . E_S
20921:6	T I does n't give them any money ,
20946:40	I know 0 they 've started over in Richardson where my dad lives *T*-1 . E_S
21041:17	it seems like nowadays everything is so electronic , you know , magnified and animated , that you can grab from the old style movies and old style shows a little bit more insight to family groupings . E_S
21146:16	And \[ AS THE WORLD TURNS . \+ I think 0 AS THE WORLD TURNS \] may , still on or not . N_S
21146:43	And \[ AS THE WORLD TURNS . \+ I think 0 AS THE WORLD TURNS \] may , still on or not . N_S
21159:51	I think 0 some of the tones of \[ the , \+ the \] daily prime time is questionable , E_S
21180:8	My younger one does n't . E_S
21246:19	um , \[ QUANTUM , LEAP has , \+ I mean QUANTUM LEAP is \] kind of a comedy in its own way , I guess 0 *T*-1 , E_S
21246:40	um , \[ QUANTUM , LEAP has , \+ I mean QUANTUM LEAP is \] kind of a comedy in its own way , I guess 0 *T*-1 , E_S
21252:11	and then NIGHT COURT is just pure , you know , weird fun , you know , E_S
21310:12	even though the person is involved in so many other people 's lives , you still see \[ a , \+ a \] real person in those situations . E_S
21326:23	Um , I think 0 my favorite show is HUNTER . E_S
21342:22	I ca n't remember what her name is *T*-1 , E_S
21413:22	and maybe that 's what the public wants *T*-1 , E_S
21446:126	But \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-3 's \] always been a formula , uh , for T V \[ that the minute that two people , \+ that the two main stars \] get married *-1 *T*-4 , that the show ends up , you know , *-2 dying . E_S
21535:56	and I think 0 they 're thinking about that exact thing , about the idea that if the show lets them , uh , get together , then you lose part of what the show 's all about *T*-1 . E_S
21758:10	But , the problem is , like 0 first time 0 I went out of here *T*-1 , \[ and \+ \] they took me to Las Vegas E_S
21901:6	my theory is , you know , 0 \[ when , \+ when \] you have kids and all *T*-1 \[ you , \+ you \] want *-2 to do , well , N_S
22009:11	Well , my dad wants me to go back . E_S
22106:62	Um , the majority of the actual gang crimes , like \[ the pat- , \+ the drive by shootings \] and stuff stays in the neighborhoods , E_S
22107:8	but the crime spreads out into the more affluent divisions through robberies , rape and , uh , car crime . E_S
22128:36	Um , there 's a lot of parking garages there because parking is very tight . E_S
22164:35	Um , in San Antonio I do n't know what the answer is *T*-1 . E_S
22169:14	I think 0 education helps a little bit there . E_S
22202:11	so that your mom does n't have a job N_S
22366:10	but any big city has a bad section . E_S
22369:15	a lot of the crime is very prevalent . E_S
22379:6	most everybody seems pretty well employed around here , E_S
22469:6	my home is in , uh , Pensacola , Florida E_S
22722:42	and it made a loud *RNR*-1 , almost a croaking *RNR*-1 noise like a croaker does E_S
22903:23	but I think 0 when the time comes *T*-1 , \[ I , \+ I \] hope *-2 to have the time 0 * to really look around , you know and pick one that I really think 0 my mother would be happy at *T*-3 *T*-4 . E_S
22920:27	There 's one close to where my mother is *T*-1 , E_S
22981:72	and , uh , \[ what I , \+ another thing 0 I \] hate *-1 to see *T*-2 is when someone has a small amount of money , and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately *T*-3 . E_S
23065:11	when the time comes *T*-1 \[ I 'm really , \+ hopefully we 'll really \] look around before I decide on one for my parents E_S
23157:7	The problem is , with a lot of it is , 0 \[ you have * to go , \+ \] you know , it takes a while * to drive to these places where you recycle it *T*-1 , you know E_S
23169:51	I 'm not exactly sure where \[ the , \+ you know , the \] can thing is *T*-1 , E_S
23204:8	But Payless Cashways has them E_S
23316:22	I do n't know what New York does *T*-1 about theirs . E_S
23407:4	Everything goes into one thing and goes out to the . N_S
23425:36	Well , if we all try a little bit , a little bit goes a long way . E_S
23431:8	If everybody tries *-1 to do just a little bit , and a little bit more then we 'll get there . E_S
23504:19	I just think 0 our system is overworked , E_S
23716:16	well , see , the problem is , 0 I 'm only twenty-two E_S
23724:9	and like somebody says okay , \[ when are , \+ when are \] we having this *T*-1 , you know , E_S
23862:6	My husband is Chinese . E_S
23895:160	And if you like Chinese food , you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it and chop some scallions and a little ginger and just cover it with some , uh , waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done , E_S
23930:4	Sole is good ,
23935:10	sole or flounder is real good .
23946:114	And then * just cover it and put it in the microwave for \[ just , \+ just \] \[ two , \+ say two \] minutes , check it after two minutes *-1 to see if the fish flakes . E_S
23950:12	And if the fish flakes , it 's done . E_S
23961:26	um , do you know what hoi sin sauce is *T*-1 , E_S
24133:17	That 's where Texas Instruments is *T*-1 . E_S
24253:19	but * being a public school teacher is entirely another thing . E_S
24535:134	I think 0 your record should stand for itself . That , you know , if you 've been tested *-1 at other companies and you 've always come up *-4 negative or whatever , then I do n't see what the big deal is *T*-2 that they have *-3 to go to all the expense of *-6 testing you over and over and over *T*-5 . E_S
24539:55	And once you 've established the fact that you 're not a drug user and especially if your personality proves that you 're not *?* . I think 0 they could , uh , save money by *-1 not doing that . You know , every time , E_S
24549:18	And that 's probably my question is , \[ how , \+ how \] do you know 0 it 's done *-1 fairly *T*-2 . E_S
24563:38	Somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person does n't win anything , and tries and tries and tries *T*-1 . You know . E_S
24588:29	. You know , as like a manager or supervisor thinks *RNR*-2 or has suspicion *RNR*-2 that someone is using drugs , E_S do you think 0 they should have the right * to send them *-1 to be tested *-2 . E_S
24601:8	and their manager assumes 0 they have a drug problem E_S
24612:83	\[ \[ and , \+ and \] it 's \+ and it 's \] based *-4 \[ on , \+ on \] a perception \[ that someone has *T*-3 \+ \] as how a drug user would behave *T*-2 when some drug users behave , uh , normal *T*-1 , uh , you know . E_S
24665:106	so I do n't know if I was n't drug tested *-1 based on that or because the man who *T*-2 hired me did n't request the drug test , because I know that my company does drug testing on occasion . E_S
24723:85	\[ But , \+ but \] see , they make that clear to them as they hire those guys \[ what , \+ what \] the drug testing schedule is *T*-1 . E_S
24789:10	even a bad school is a good school up here , where , if I lived in New York City or Washington , D C , uh , I would seriously consider * moving if I had a child . E_S
24834:36	it 's like \[ if , \+ if \] your father owns a grocery store and you 're really interested in that , E_S there 's no reason that you should take college prep courses *T*-1 when you can get some general business courses in high school *T*-2 . E_S
24882:46	well \[ I could , \+ I could \] see 0 if a kid does n't have any encouragement if , \[ t- , \+ they 're , \] you know , come from a broken home and their parents are more concerned about *-1 trying *-2 to work E_S
24920:10	if the industry comes hopefully they 'll promote good schools . E_S
24924:85	Because I know 0 the town that I come from *T*-1 \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ uh , the \] large I B M plant has something 0 * to do *T*-2 with the top rated high school because of their tax base for one E_S
25063:161	and there are going *-1 to be people who *T*-2 die because of it because they do n't understand , uh , you know , simple things from the amount of medicine 0 they should take *T*-3 to how fast they can drive *T*-4 and you know how far away something is *T*-5 E_S
25072:6	our land is in acres , E_S
25073:41	our people are n't going *-1 to understand what an amount of something is *T*-2 . E_S
25087:53	it seems almost like \[ there 's this , \+ \] it 's a peer pressure thing is why we keep *-1 wanting *-1 to do it *T*-2 is so we 'll look good to the other nations E_S
25130:6	my husband is *?* , E_S
25195:8	the American family does n't need any more pressure . E_S
25300:8	but the break is over . E_S
25357:38	And what that tells me *T*-1 , is that the summer weather is very predictable , that it does n't vary very much . E_S
25494:22	\[ so , \+ and \] my handicap is twenty nine . E_S
26017:6	And interest is like eighteen or something . E_S
26022:51	well , of course on the green card you have *-1 to pay it when the bill comes in *T*-2 ,
26053:7	Now Impact is kind of bad too , though . E_S
26063:4	Plastic is just too easy , E_S
26082:11	Oh , my husband says 0 I might buy it , E_S
26176:11	and actually Service Merchandise is cheaper than them now . E_S
26275:10	but I B M is what I 'm looking at *T*-1 right now . E_S
26503:42	Uh , \[ I , \+ I \] ca n't remember what the name is *T*-1 . E_S
26661:6	College credit is a good idea because , N_S
26743:17	and that 's the other thing is that , you know , instead of *-1 making it mandatory , they maybe need *-1 to publicize it a little bit better . and , uh , you know , go to the schools and do programs , and tell them that we need your help , and , you know , uh , * volunteer for such and such a time , E_S
26909:11	Well , my degree is in teaching , E_S
27029:15	and , uh , this kid comes to school with his lunch box E_S
27119:24	and I 've seen how their school system works *T*-1 E_S
27322:22	I do n't know what the answer is *T*-1 . E_S
27492:9	Um , problem i- , N_S
27592:37	because \[ it , \+ uh , it \] seems like everybody has \[ a , \+ \] you know , *-1 to go in and do , N_S
27611:12	the mold , everything is white . E_S
27615:14	In a new house everything is white . E_S
27684:9	because the house has so many windows E_S
27689:38	\[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] living room has four , uh , good size windows E_S
27703:6	the color does n't really matter \[ for , \+ \] because you have that light . E_S
27714:25	but \[ the , \+ the \] interesting thing is 0 that paint we wound up *-1 having *-2 to go back and scrape some of that away E_S
27716:118	it kind of bled under the masking tape which , I guess , *T*-1 is probably the topic 0 \[ we 're \+ we 're \] really on to *T*-2 \[ that , \+ that \] the masking is , N_S
27758:12	at the time country tells more of \[ a , \+ a \] story . E_S
27792:10	And my classical music tends *-1 to be confined *-2 to the seventeen hundreds , early eighteen hundred music . E_S
27826:11	uh , Barry Manilow comes to mind
28013:34	\[ but \+ but , \] uh , a really good day care is probably going *-1 to cost more than you 're going *-2 to make at the job . E_S
28044:10	and your work schedule is . N_S
28177:133	Well , \[ so , \+ so \] that 's another thing that *T*-1 has *-2 to adapt is , you know , \[ the , \+ the \] father 's attitudes about , you know , \[ who , \+ whose \] job is this *T*-3 . E_S
28183:16	to me the only important issue is the children , E_S
28184:17	because as far as housework goes , you know , men can do housework just as easily as women , E_S
28185:29	and thanks to a lot of new inventions , housework does n't take as much time as it used *-1 to *?* . E_S
28272:160	\[ \[ It 's not , \+ they 're not going *-7 to , \] \+ the boys in this next generation are not going *-1 to \] have *-2 to be told *-3 as much this needs *-4 to be done *-5 , because mom was there *-6 saying that dad is there , you know , E_S
28311:26	Un , you know some time day care is really good , E_S
28339:12	But if no one does anything when they 're little *T*-1 , then it 's twice as hard \[ as , \+ I think 0 *T*-2 , as \] they get older . E_S
28421:29	So all 0 I have *T*-1 on my desk is my P C , E_S
28430:34	And , um , you know , every now and then the file gets so big , that , you know , it moves slower than I 'd like *?* E_S
28461:52	so I ended up *-1 taking on the load of *-2 making * sure 0 everybody knows what they 're doing *T*-3 E_S
28605:6	Hewlett Packard makes ,
28610:8	but the quality is almost laser quality . E_S
28709:18	well , see , the entire bank is not like that . E_S
28711:23	\[ the , \+ the \] bank philosophy is one of innovation and , * Lead the market . E_S
28755:22	And the doctor said that running and jumping is n't real good for my knee anymore , E_S
28764:13	see over thirty-five everything goes downhill flop . E_S
28816:51	Well , I mean , \[ if , \+ if \] you know what your routine is *T*-1 , you can do that by yourself , E_S
28842:25	I have been told *-1 0 that thing is just lovely . E_S
28984:68	And they told me \[ that , \+ \] uh , oh , well , you know , you know , your husband works here E_S
29008:6	flex time is great . E_S
29086:10	the Spring Creek one is a lot more modern , has a lot more niceties , amenities E_S
29121:99	and , uh , uh , today we 're not even suppose *-2 to be in school because \[ the , \+ uh , the \] way 0 the taxation and all that crap is *T*-1 , there really legally is n't any funding for the school systems in Texas today . E_S
29168:135	\[ Ha- , \+ \] \[ \[ they do n't even , \+ a lot of the school systems do n't even , \] \+ uh , the kids nowadays do n't even \] know \[ what , \+ what \] the president 's fitness education program is all about *T*-1 , E_S
29309:17	Um , the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour is on public television E_S
29316:42	Um , one of the women that I work with *T*-1 , her husband is Iranian . E_S
29335:77	Well \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ uh , I \] like the print news much better than the television news because television news tends *-1 to sensationalize . E_S
29401:67	And they seemed *-1 to mold the events to their view of the world , which I suppose 0 just about everyone does *T*-2 , E_S
29554:6	This newspaper has the far side and the comics that I enjoy *T*-1 E_S
29571:24	And \[ my , \+ My \] fiancee takes probably six Sunday papers . E_S
29781:19	Do you know what my concern is *T*-1 ? E_S
29879:27	I ca n't really watch television if the pattern is very intricate . E_S
30053:104	I know 0 \[ when I travel *T*-1 , \+ or when I used *-2 to travel overseas quite a bit *T*-3 , \] what I would do *T*-4 on my American Express card is \[ before I would , \+ before I left \] I would mail a check \[ to , \+ to \] American Express and , you know , have some idea of how much *T*-5 was there , you know ,
30214:21	\[ Your , \+ your \] speech is very exact . E_S
30391:69	Now I know 0 my boss has bought the software , um , \[ that he can , \+ that his \] checkbook is \[ \[ on , \+ on \] \+ on \] a disk , E_S
30476:4	everything has *-1 to be typed *-2 . E_S
30880:21	it 's just that the rating system seems , you know ,
30997:42	Uh , \[ if , \+ if \] that is that the second one follows the first . E_S
31149:49	That 's pretty interesting \[ because just , \+ just because \] you know a subject matter does n't mean 0 you can teach it . E_S
31160:62	In fact , I think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] one of the big problems today is \[ the , \+ the \] way 0 the kids behave or act *T*-2 \[ and , \+ and \] the way 0 they are sometimes disinterested in what *T*-1 's going on in the class and disruptive *T*-3 . E_S
31184:33	My God , I think 0 it would be next year is what I 'd read *T*-1 . E_S
31227:9	\[ Nobody has , \+ nobody has \] a nongifted child . E_S
31227:20	\[ Nobody has , \+ nobody has \] a nongifted child . E_S
31277:68	there 's such \[ a , \+ a \] push among young mothers these days *-1 to make * sure 0 their child is computer literate . E_S
31337:40	And then \[ the , \+ you know , the \] old social conscience says , you know , I 'm not working ,
31437:46	But , um , in \[ many , \+ many \] cases whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs , it 's not even going *-1 to effect anybody but \[ his , \+ uh , you know , himself \] and his own family , perhaps , um , depending on the kind of drug 0 he might be on *T*-2 . E_S
31472:27	And I think , personally , 0 the drastic step has *-1 to be \[ that , \+ um , that \] you ca n't work if you continue *-2 taking drugs . E_S
31512:48	But , um , the effect that it 's had *T*-1 on this young man 's life is so dramatic that it 's heartbreaking E_S
31584:60	Personally , I think 0 that 's what I was about *-1 to say *T*-2 is that everyone needs *-3 to be tested *-4 . E_S
31605:10	But the bottom line is \[ that , \+ that \] \[ if , \+ if \] you 're going *-1 to stay clean and straight , then , um , \[ you 're , \+ you 're \] going *-2 to do that because you want *-3 to *?* . E_S
31726:6	My sister tries *-1 to set up a greenhouse on her back deck E_S
31771:11	Well , my brother lives ten miles from here E_S
31848:6	my sister grows flowers that you can dry *T*-1 , E_S
31858:30	\[ Yo- , \+ you \] know what eucalyptus is *T*-1 ? E_S

32066:4	Everything does real well here in the spring until about , oh , first part of June E_S
32110:59	\[ I like the way that , \+ I like the way that \] idea of the south is *T*-1 , E_S
32136:4	Houston is really humid . E_S
32628:10	but the Texas soil is n't the greatest , gardening soil . E_S
32686:15	My neighbor across the street has one . E_S
32789:15	and , uh , my wife does , uh , a small herb garden on the side . E_S
32853:11	and then my wife puts them on pizzas . \[ And , \+ and \] chops them up in recipes and things like that . E_S
33032:21	\[ shrimp , \+ shrimp \] fettucini is real easy * to , um , make and everything E_S
33061:68	you can always tell whenever they 're cooked *-1 *T*-2 if they 've been dead for a long time because their tail straightens out . E_S
33074:12	but if the tail is straight on it then , yeah , * do n't eat it . E_S
33103:57	But \[ there 's a , \+ There 's a , \] big thing *ICH*-1 over here that everybody sucks the head . E_S
33148:42	We have \[ a \+ a \] friend another couple where the husband is the one who *T*-1 cooks all the time *T*-2 E_S
33332:11	And then the sauce is just made *-1 with um bouillion cubes water burgundy wine and um cornstarch instead of flour E_S
33467:4	Exercise is not supposed *-1 to do that to you . E_S
33512:12	Even the Spring Creek one has a lot of weights in it . E_S
33833:8	And his name is B J . E_S
33962:11	Uh , the ammunition is probably so old 0 I 'm afraid *-1 to use it . E_S
33982:11	Uh , my gun has n't been shot *-1 in a year or two . E_S
34042:5	somebody wants *-1 to do that , N_S
34049:6	A shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does . E_S
34049:22	A shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does . E_S
34072:8	And the spread changes . E_S
34076:57	The further away 0 I get *T*-1 , \[ the , \+ the , \] uh , wider the shot gets *T*-2 from the target . E_S
34220:21	Well , see , uh , my husband has a thing . E_S
34230:6	My husband feels that they 'll come and collect everybody 's guns . E_S
34258:71	\[ You , \+ you \] were talking about , uh , uh , \[ Fed- , \+ what *ICH*-2 the Federal \] government knows *T*-1 about people . E_S
34333:4	Control is something that I would n't want the Federal government to have *T*-1 . E_S
34362:9	but my preference is the one 0 we saw *T*-1 before that was SILENCE OF THE LAMBS . E_S
34437:79	I mean , I 'm sure 0 I 'm going *-1 to be seeing it because in a week to Amarillo where my sister lives *T*-2 ,
34551:19	because , I mean , everybody grows up *-1 looking at these cop movies and trying *-2 \[ to , \+ you know , to \] imitate them or whatever . E_S
34706:12	You know popcorn is not that expensive . E_S
34850:6	my husband keeps *-1 wanting *-2 to . E_S
35081:37	I do n't understand why , first of all , the public puts up with it *T*-1 . Second of all , why the networks think that , you know , we enjoy that kind of stuff *T*-2 . E_S
35194:63	and then you 're , you know , trying *-1 to pass the time *-2 to wait until the next comedian comes up . E_S
35345:8	and my fiancee has two kids E_S
35447:38	That 's what I 'm thinking about *T*-1 on my next car is do I want *-2 to get another brand new car because last two cars are brand new E_S
35625:13	What kind of car is it *T*-1 ? E_S
35836:14	I mean , everybody does . E_S
36211:20	I mean , my other pet peeve is unions . E_S
36343:21	and so , at the time , walking seems *-1 to be the best . E_S
36465:14	But the T I rec center has an aerobics program \[ for , \+ for , \] um , prenatal and postnatal aerobic type thing . E_S
36631:57	up here you got *-1 to wait until , \[ Aug- , \+ August , \] until the water warms up . E_S

36712:6	that place is great , E_S

36812:6	my brother has a real nice pop-up . E_S
36911:71	\[ \[ they 're , \+ they 're , \] \+ uh , it 's \] like a little house except the whole face is open , E_S
36922:6	this topic is , is Russia a threat to our security ? E_S
36927:4	Everybody wants *-1 to defect , E_S
36929:23	Um , I think 0 their biggest problem is just , you know , * obtaining food 0 * to live *T*-1 , E_S
36939:14	I believe 0 Communism is very much waning . E_S
36941:29	and the Russian people are all realizing that the Communist system does not work to their satisfaction or their way of * surviving in this world , E_S
36954:57	Well , \[ I do , \+ I do \] realize that , uh , uh , the Bush Administration is n't too happy \[ with , \+ with \] how they 're handling their internal , uh , strife *T*-2 , you know , as far as diplomacy is concerned *-1 . E_S
36961:14	I think 0 Gorbachev realizes that he 's got \[ a , \+ a \] major uh , uh , power figure , you know , competing against him , E_S
36981:6	but Gorbachev has still not fully convinced everyone that , he 's moving towards a two to three party system of government \[ that , \+ \] nor eliminating or diminishing the Communist power , E_S
36984:27	and I guess 0 that 's where Yeltsin steps in *T*-1 , so far as his politics of government goes , uh , E_S
36984:60	and I guess 0 that 's where Yeltsin steps in *T*-1 , so far as his politics of government goes , uh , E_S
36995:85	\[ \[ I , \+ it , \] \+ it 's \] just that , 0 the weird thing \[ is *T*-2 , \+ is \] that Gorbachev is the one that *T*-1 opened the floodgates , as far as with glasnost and \[ poistro- , \+ perestroika \] and stuff , E_S
37026:25	What *T*-1 's bad for the Soviet system is that , they have the resources 0 * to grow and produce their food *T*-2 , E_S but somehow it just does not get out to the market the way 0 it should *?* *T*-1 . E_S
37052:72	but you know , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] what *T*-1 happens when , you know , the cork blows *T*-2 E_S and you ca n't handle it anymore . E_S
37105:48	The only yes 0 I could go to *T*-1 is if uh , a renegade crew decides *-2 to launch an attack or an accidental launching or something to that effect \[ to , \+ to \] a nuclear exchange , E_S
37196:19	and that 's where the problem is *T*-1 really . E_S
37402:43	but I do n't get into , you know , how many errors somebody has *T*-1 or things like that . E_S
37429:34	Well \[ what the , \+ what the \] argument is *T*-1 E_S
37466:44	I do n't understand \[ the , \+ the \] strategy of how baseball works *T*-1 , E_S
37492:11	and finally a guy gets up there and blasts a home run E_S
37493:23	and that 's all 0 the game is *T*-1 . E_S
37537:44	baseball \[ is their , \+ is their \] life up there like football is *?* down here I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
37544:19	\[ Ye- , \+ \] everybody does , right . E_S
37590:22	\[ And , \+ and \] the question is how do you forecast that *T*-1 , E_S
37630:10	and , his argument is that uh , the ownership is not inclined *-1 to lose big money long enough *-2 \[ to , \+ to \] bring in the big dollars . E_S
37630:27	and , his argument is that uh , the ownership is not inclined *-1 to lose big money long enough *-2 \[ to , \+ to \] bring in the big dollars . E_S
37661:11	* spending money does n't guarantee you , uh , winning a pennant . E_S
37717:82	we 're going *-1 to talk about the public school system , What *T*-2 's wrong with it , \[ an , \+ or \] if anything is wrong with it and what we can do *T*-3 about it , what *T*-4 should be done *-6 about it . E_S
37924:60	And what 's it going *-1 to be like *T*-2 in another twelve years when my , uh , oldest son is in high school *T*-3 . E_S
38013:6	What processor does it have *T*-1 in it ? E_S
38040:6	my husband does , too , E_S
38071:28	Your husband , \[ what , \+ what \] group is your husband in *T*-1 ? E_S
38208:11	Well , my husband does n't have *-1 to travel , E_S
38471:6	Your name is Lynn ? E_S
38655:10	and his whole idea is , 0 we can build a better world if people get involved in good community building projects . E_S
38686:25	I ca n't think of what his name is *T*-1 \[ right , \+ right \] off the bat , though . E_S
38823:17	I 'd say 0 reading is probably one of my biggest ones , because it 's the type of thing that \[ you can , \+ you can \] do *T*-1 a little bit at a time , whereas ,
38835:4	Reading is a little bit easier 0 * to work around *T*-1 . E_S
39035:6	and watering is okay . E_S
39127:92	and it helps because it 's the time of the year that they 're shedding a lot *T*-1 , and * cleaning cat fur off the couch and off the floor is not a hobby of mine . E_S
39160:8	and my husband likes cats . E_S
39167:62	but since I 'm in an apartment , \[ I just , \+ I \] do n't think 0 an apartment is big enough for a dog . E_S
39283:15	And , um , the cafeteria is real good about * putting out recipes , you know ,
39608:6	And everybody loves it E_S
39794:11	Uh , the college ranks , um , I guess I really , N_S
39843:41	so the only basketball team , pro anyway , in that part of the country is Chicago . E_S
39848:24	I mean , of course , this year is a good year 0 * to be \[ a , \+ a \] Chicago \[ B- , \+ \] fan *T*-1 , I guess 0 *T*-2 , because they 're doing pretty good . E_S
40007:14	I think 0 Magic does a , N_S
40036:9	uh , Detroit has n't been having that great a year this year . E_S
40213:4	Phoenix is n't doing too bad . E_S
40324:105	I mean \[ I , \+ I \] kind of looked at it like if you take him to a home \[ with a , \+ with \] private individual , when the door shuts *T*-1 , that one person has total control , E_S
40324:120	I mean \[ I , \+ I \] kind of looked at it like if you take him to a home \[ with a , \+ with \] private individual , when the door shuts *T*-1 , that one person has total control , E_S
40434:8	My oldest one is ten and a half now ,
40493:18	and , uh , when school lets out *T*-1 , \[ \[ I just do n't , \+ I have n't , \] \+ I have \] no idea what I 'm going *-2 to do *T*-3 , because I certainly ca n't afford what we did *T*-4 last year which *T*-5 was , N_S
40518:6	that stuff is expensive . E_S
40631:8	but the thing is 0 he was in school all day , in second grade , E_S
40760:6	Day care has just done just incredible stuff with him E_S
40787:25	whenever you say Bright Steps *T*-1 , everybody goes , oh , I 've heard 0 that 's the best day care in town , you know , E_S
40796:54	and \[ they have , \+ \[ \[ this , \+ this , \] \+ this \] woman owns \] three day cares , two in Lewisville and one in Irving . E_S
40909:23	you know , your peace of mind is worth a little bit of money , you know , E_S
40923:8	since Galen goes to nursery school , we pay \[ \[ our , \+ our \] home care provider , \+ for our day care provider , \] full time for a whole week , E_S
41059:35	and he kept *-1 saying , this is where my uncle lives *T*-2 E_S
41067:4	Nobody has this many relatives , you know . E_S
41155:21	I do n't think 0 my family is as big as your husband 's . E_S
41157:15	but , um , the problem is 0 we are all really scattered , around . E_S
41264:28	\[ but , \+ uh , and then \] everybody goes to that place . E_S
41523:6	the thing is 0 I know a lot of stories , E_S
41587:95	so . \[ It , \+ it , \] uh , definitely fluctuates mainly with what I 'm going *-1 to be doing *T*-2 that day and kind of what my mood is *T*-3 E_S
41620:20	but , for some reason a mini skirt is , to me a little more unprofessional 0 * to wear *T*-1 to work than jeans E_S
41775:53	And , so , uh , uh , I just feel that , uh , you know each person has *-1 to dress to their own liking and for their own comfort . E_S
41782:56	that 's \[ what I , \+ one thing 0 I \] like *T*-2 about T I is that they are n't overly strict about what you wear *T*-3 E_S
41783:36	and \[ they do n't , \+ you know , your boss does n't \] come up to you and say now * remember , tomorrow you have a meeting
42099:8	the same thing goes with some of these insanity pleas , you know . E_S
42232:10	and their little boy is like five , you know , E_S
42435:19	It 's just 0 the system has just , N_S
42455:38	I 'm not a member of the N R A although my , father is *?* . E_S
42502:13	If the gun shop owner does it , N_S
42568:46	\[ I , \+ I \] imagine 0 \[ his , \+ his \] opinion is a little bit towards the one there , on the scale of one to ten

42614:9	If your child is old enough , N_S
42624:8	and a cop comes up , N_S
42663:6	A gun is a gun to them . E_S
43036:111	and after three years of *-1 working at it , \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] been amazed at just what a little bit of * doing * help out things to the lawn has really brought it back *T*-2 . E_S
43212:6	not everybody enjoys it , though . E_S
43213:4	Everybody has a different thing . E_S
43215:8	and my husband does n't . E_S
43245:29	and half of it 's , N_S the back half is my garden . E_S
43506:11	Oh , the book is really good . E_S
43538:11	And then the cat gets , um , on this treacherous journey . E_S
43552:23	and MUMBLEx . Of course , the only sound is Dudley Moore narrates it . E_S
43552:32	and MUMBLEx . Of course , the only sound is Dudley Moore narrates it . E_S
43662:5	FREDDY EATS A NUCLEAR WARHEAD , you know . E_S
43705:6	my husband does that . E_S
43890:29	That 's what they *T*-2 when the thing has n't won any award *T*-1 . E_S
43938:9	Uh , painting is not hard 0 * to do *T*-1 , uh , as long as it 's \[ not in , \+ not to \] the point of where it 's , uh , needs *-2 to be scraped *-3 and \[ bl- , \+ \] peeling *T*-4 , E_S
43945:8	and our house is not *?* N_S
43982:11	right now our house does n't have *-1 to have the same kind of exterior painting there , E_S
43989:6	the problem is that \[ it hits , \+ the sun hits \] it . E_S
43989:34	the problem is that \[ it hits , \+ the sun hits \] it . E_S
44131:16	Just that , uh , money is power , E_S
44179:12	even if a country chooses a government that *T*-1 's not , you know , exactly the kind of government that we have *T*-2 , you know \[ or , \+ or \] as in complete opposition to it , at least it 's their choice , \[ as long , \+ as long \] it 's one \[ that *T*-3 's , \+ \[ that , \+ that \] \] *T*-4 makes since , * so to speak , you know , E_S
44191:16	and then amazingly enough the country starts *-1 turning against our leader , you know . E_S
44198:4	America starts *-1 talking then about *-2 removing bases \[ and , \+ and \] whatnot and , stuff like that , and people . E_S
44276:23	I think , uh , 0 Central America has always been one of those places where people are more passive *T*-2 , you know , where it 's always the minority that *T*-1 \[ are , \+ are \] trying *-4 to make the country better *T*-3 . E_S
44286:22	sometimes I think 0 *T*-1 a religion has a lot 0 *T*-2 to do with that . E_S
44365:8	the poverty level is certainly , uh , you know , much worse in the Latin American countries . E_S
44367:52	I think 0 it has something 0 *T*-1 to do with the poverty level because Africa is certainly not a Catholic , uh , country , E_S
44397:74	or like you say , maybe communication of * knowing that , hey , up in other English colonies , or previous English colonies , everything is equal and yet down there it 's not *?* , E_S
44405:11	because the black community is still not very educated down there . E_S
44436:50	that 's sort of upsetting , * to think that we 're richer and yet everybody is intellectually poorer . E_S
44450:14	I mean good education is really still free . E_S
44571:26	well . \[ My , \+ my \] mother has one that *T*-1 's , uh , N_S
44575:25	the way 0 my mom 's presence countenance is *T*-1 , \[ just , \+ just \] for * having a puppy E_S
44603:8	And this cat is like no other cat 0 I have ever seen *T*-1 . E_S
44743:29	Well , \[ the , \+ see the \] problem is 0 \[ \[ if , \+ if the , \] \+ if someone \] would have came up to me and said it 's going *-1 to cost you five hundred dollars *-2 to keep your dog alive . E_S What do you want *-1 to do *T*-2 ? E_S I probably would have had second thoughts . E_S
44845:73	I think 0 it 's somewhere really close to that cause I think 0 a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going *-1 to make that much difference . E_S
44857:64	And I think 0 one of the good ways of * solving that is \[ to \+ like , everybody likes *-1 to come to \] a party so * have a voting party \[ and , \+ \] uh , you know , like in communities and have the issues there and then everybody go *-2 vote together and then maybe come back over and have brunch or something . E_S
44878:15	and , uh , not everyone votes at the same place . E_S
44931:14	but down here , Louisiana has a bad reputation for their politicians and all . E_S
44964:6	One crook is as good as the other one . E_S
44974:24	I do n't care how small the ballot is *T*-1 , I mean , if there 's one thing , if there 's one issue , E_S
45052:30	And , okay , \[ this , \+ this \] candidate tells you some things that *T*-1 are going *-2 to happen E_S
45056:8	and this candidate tells you some things . E_S
45066:42	but you 're going *-1 to have *-2 to do what that person says *T*-3 , E_S

59222:20	I do n't care what anybody tells you *T*-1 . E_S
59263:8	All my income goes for things like luxuries , E_S
59326:30	I do n't know if the T I in Dallas does or not . E_S
59368:14	It 's pretty power is n't it *?* ? E_S
59470:29	but , uh , I certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm that have as much responsibility * to know how * do , use it safely *T*-2 as someone learns how * to drive *T*-1 , if not more so . E_S
59470:99	but , uh , I certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm that have as much responsibility * to know how * do , use it safely *T*-2 as someone learns how * to drive *T*-1 , if not more so . E_S
59520:5	someone attempts *-1 to mug me I would ju- , N_S
59526:13	Now if this legislation comes through , E_S
59534:6	this guy comes up , E_S
59570:24	the fact that everybody is packing a piece is a deterrence for someone saying , well , I 'm going *-1 to mug this guy right here E_S
59604:41	\[ This , \+ this \] is where the question of gun control comes in *T*-1 . E_S
59609:23	What , I consider *T*-1 gun control is * being able *-2 to hit my target with the first shot . E_S
59622:25	And I make * sure 0 this persons sees it so that he 's got now doubt that I will use it on him E_S and I will use it right then . E_S
59648:8	the whole system needs changing , E_S
60385:11	So the general topic is hobbies . E_S
60427:30	\[ Wh- , \+ what \] kind of time frame is it , uh , looking *T*-1 for the , uh , different shifts up there ? E_S
60433:55	basically , I had read that they 're just looking at *-1 relocating them all to McKinney is it *RNR*-2 , Texas , E_S
60491:67	\[ And , \+ uh , and , \] uh , M C I -s coming \[ if , \+ if , \] telemarketing is your bag . E_S
60564:41	Well , the one thing I guess 0 *T*-1 at least in your favor is \[ the , \+ the \] fact that , that is more in the support of the manufacturing E_S
60621:37	But then \[ they , \+ they \] tell me 0 Hell is much better than west Texas . E_S
60654:37	\[ it , \+ it \] takes a bit of a shift does n't it . E_S
60685:4	momentum is , uh , driving force in our lives . E_S
60749:27	and that actually , um , as our population increases and , you know , \[ \[ \[ our , \+ of course , our , \] \+ our cars , \] \+ you know , our number of cars *ICH*-1 \] increase per the population , that 's the problem .
60839:22	the \[ we- , \+ \] east side does . E_S
60886:58	and I think , well , what if somebody 's dumped something back there in the , and no one knows about it and , you know , it sinked in through the ground and all that , E_S
60892:34	\[ it 's , \+ it 's \] where Stillwater is *T*-1 or , sweet , N_S
60939:8	and this thing says \[ that , \+ that , \] you know , \[ it- , \+ \] people think , well , cow manure is good for fertilizer E_S
60939:76	and this thing says \[ that , \+ that , \] you know , \[ it- , \+ \] people think , well , cow manure is good for fertilizer E_S
61003:45	But , um , I mean , \[ ev- , \+ evidently \] a normal cow produces that much too , E_S
61033:9	and the smell is really bad they sa- , N_S
61098:44	but , uh , I think 0 \[ the only , \+ the main \] thing is * just keep on \[ the , legis- , \+ your legislator 's \] back , you know , as far as , N_S
61142:15	What kind of a dog is he *T*-1 ? E_S
61211:8	And her name is Angel . E_S
61215:8	and his name is Dominique . E_S
61650:21	they get it if the other cat has it E_S
61674:6	My wife works out of \[ the home , \+ our home . \] E_S
61712:62	but if they were careful , they could make the use of it totally without * understanding how the computer works *T*-1 . E_S
61717:11	For the average person is *T*-2 exactly what he can use it for *T*-1 . E_S
61718:12	And if your wife is n't working out of the home and sending letters E_S
61721:18	\[ there , \+ your issue is then there \] really , N_S
61723:14	Well , uh , space is a handicap with me , E_S
61792:11	And then the keyboard is another fifty , E_S
61794:13	and then the disk drive is two fifty . E_S
61798:35	Well , \[ that 's \+ that 's \] the deal is 0 you 're not buying brands now , E_S
61811:13	But \[ the book is , \+ the magazine is \] full of these \[ mail order , \+ computer mail-order \] houses E_S
61811:26	But \[ the book is , \+ the magazine is \] full of these \[ mail order , \+ computer mail-order \] houses E_S
61897:28	And of course now that is where a computer is very handy *T*-1 . E_S
61911:11	so naturally our equipment has *-1 to be in top condition and is constantly calibrated *-1 , E_S
62144:8	the Kurdish community is a little bit extreme at this time , E_S
62178:41	sad little things . Uh , I felt sorry for them . Because their society is n't there anymore , E_S
62193:40	So , \[ I , \+ I 'm \] wondering if the Peace Corps is , really an effective tool . E_S
62323:4	Shopping is no fun anymore . E_S
62415:8	but the problem is that you ca n't put the type of card that we need *T*-1 to put in it , in it . And even though they told us in advance that you could *?* , E_S
62447:6	my husband goes *-1 to pick it up last week E_S
62477:25	\[ and , \+ and so \] much time goes past before you finally get any kind of satisfaction . E_S
62563:36	and she says 0 it 's wrong too because the little thing pokes out too far , E_S
62570:6	What brand is it *T*-1 ? E_S
62684:28	Well , I think 0 part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship . E_S
62693:6	nobody cares , \[ no , \+ nobody 's , \] really paying , N_S
62755:52	\[ \[ \[ The , \+ the , \] \+ the \] \+ that \] the value is in * doing it well E_S
62883:8	and this session is about *-1 to run out . E_S
62912:18	And I think 0 another thing is that my friend that *T*-1 was taking with me the first two months was n't *?* the second two months . E_S
62926:14	Like it 's misery loves company . E_S
62981:4	walking is kind of boring . E_S
62996:8	and the aerobics is n't too boring . E_S
63038:8	But my dragginess is my excuse for * not exercising . E_S
63051:20	It 's kind of a vicious circle is n't it *?* ? E_S
63063:71	I know , you know , from everything that you read *T*-1 and you see *T*-1 on television now , 0 exercise is so important to good health . E_S
63176:53	They even have some , uh , \[ aerobic , \+ uh , water aerobics \] when the weather gets nice *T*-1 out in the pool . E_S
63331:9	course this country is n't a dictatorship , E_S
63337:9	Well , thing is , 0 it 's a \[ global , \+ global \] market place these days , E_S
63428:6	and temperature is the big thing the Centigrade for which she says Celsius *T*-1 . E_S
63445:31	\[ So , \+ but , \] uh . The big problem is not * having \[ the , \+ uh , the \] resolution \[ between temperature , \+ you know , between a hundred , \] if you 're talking about a hundred degrees or what , thirty , zero , you know thirty four degrees , whatever that is *T*-1 . E_S
63513:18	Matter of fact , the thing is , 0 I always say 0 it 's built *-1 off shore , you know , because it was assembled *-2 in Canada . E_S
63542:13	hundreds on the sign looks lot better than fifty five , E_S
63561:17	Well they converted all the road signs to fifty-five miles an hour , you know , E_S
63732:23	But I did n't realize that our garbage is n't being decomposed *-1 . E_S
63766:8	but the cost is kind of prohibitive . E_S
63811:44	and , they do n't expand \[ or , \+ or \] contract when the weather changes *T*-1 , E_S
63849:10	but my biggest problem is , 0 I take the bags out of the store , buy the bags * to bring the back , E_S
63858:90	I think 0 that 's just the biggest problem is keeping it \[ in , \+ in \] front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is *T*-1 , and how important it *EXP*-3 is *T*-2 * to do that . E_S
64030:9	Well , Texas is n't bad . E_S
64040:4	Spring is nice . E_S
64143:27	it 's in Garland where all the bad weather is *T*-1 . E_S
64165:61	But I guess 0 you just tend *-1 to think \[ of , \+ of \] where your house is *T*-2 you know , and nothing else . E_S
64175:6	The creek overflows E_S
64261:80	I 'm going *-1 to have *-2 to get a map *-1 to figure out exactly where is the golf course *T*-3 versus where my house is *T*-4 . E_S
64358:18	I know where MUMBLEx Valley is *T*-1 , E_S
64373:6	The elevation is extremely high . E_S
64491:59	Though \[ I , \+ I \] could n't tell you anything about them other than when my wife says , This is Bach *T*-1 , you know . E_S
64535:37	About the only thing 0 I can remember *T*-1 after the song is over is the refrain . E_S
64632:4	Chicago has a lot of good stations , uh , E_S
64689:34	On fact , \[ my , \+ uh , my \] grandmother does that a lot , because she 's blind , E_S
64729:34	\[ But I , \+ but I \] guess 0 music comes into that whole aspect of listening . So as long 0 you 're listening . E_S
65105:69	but I do read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED * \[ i- , \+ \] during \[ the , \+ the \] year because my son gets that . E_S
65152:13	BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM starts off , you know , in the eighteen forties , you know .
65282:8	the other stuff is interesting E_S
65434:29	And , uh , we usually sit there unless somebody gives us tickets , you know , box seats or something ,
65532:16	And I think 0 Dallas has enough *ICH*-3 0 * to offer *T*-1 that they do n't have *-2 to hog everything . E_S
65577:9	Now my son does , E_S
65661:163	I mean , they 're talking about , uh , * having it , uh , as a , you know , business . Uh , \[ \[ * to , \+ uh , you know , * to , \] \+ so , \] \[ the , \+ you know , the \] government does n't have *-1 to deal with it . E_S
65755:13	Uh , E_S my perspective is that , you know , I 've been with a couple of big companies now . E_S
65997:42	Just \[ I fe- , \+ I feel \] like even that little bit helps . E_S
66082:57	\[ it 's \+ \] bad because if \[ you , \+ you know , your \] bill is due on the fifteenth then \[ i- , \+ \] \[ \[ \[ \[ y- , \+ y- , \] \+ y- , \] \+ you- , \] \+ you 're \] not past due until the fifteenth of the next month . E_S
66131:16	I think that Discover Card has a good idea with , you know , * giving you a little cash back incentive for each amount 0 \[ you , \+ you \] purchase *T*-1 . As long as you do n't go crazy *-2 trying *-3 to get cash back . E_S
66308:14	Anyway , well the question is , you know , do you think , 0 \[ i- , \+ it \] does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime E_S or do you think 0 it can *?* if it 's done *-1 right ? E_S
66308:91	Anyway , well the question is , you know , do you think , 0 \[ i- , \+ it \] does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime E_S or do you think 0 it can *?* if it 's done *-1 right ? E_S
66332:45	and so , uh , you know , \[ their , \+ their \] success rate is very high . E_S
66345:23	But , I mean , uh , Baltimore has , uh , an all time record for the number of deaths so far this year . E_S
66363:8	the only consolation is 0 so many of the murders are , you know , N_S the , the violent people going against each other E_S
66367:42	Uh , N_S \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say , you know , this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society *T*-1 E_S
66367:104	Uh , N_S \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say , you know , this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society *T*-1 E_S
66555:16	Uh , right now my exercise is pretty much limited to , uh , softball league and occasional ride on the bike , E_S
66724:24	hopefully \[ my , \+ my \] knee is a hundred percent better . E_S
66773:19	you know where the little bridge is on North Oak Cliff Boulevard *T*-1 ? E_S
66781:11	uh , our street is uh , an awful lot of retired people , E_S
66786:6	and everybody is real excited . E_S
66886:6	The problem is 0 she 's a school teacher E_S
66911:8	and the street does n't go anywhere . E_S
66984:11	Uh , the amount varies E_S
66997:25	But , uh , I guess 0 the bicycling is the one thing 0 I 'll sort of , like , do *T*-1 if I feel like I need *-2 to go *-3 exercise . E_S
67005:17	Uh , out near my house is pretty hilly . E_S
67075:73	but , uh , I 'm looking at , uh , *-1 doing a lot more of it because , you know , my wife is really into it , E_S
67133:4	Bicycling is really big here . E_S
67287:11	So , what school is it *T*-1 ? E_S
67378:6	my husband calls her street dog , E_S
67516:27	\[ And , \+ uh , and \] her nose is that pink , you know , E_S
67554:28	\[ This , \+ this \] friend of mine has , th- ,
67676:49	\[ and , \+ uh , an \] part of \[ the , \+ the \] movie is where he 's trying *-1 to clean this dog up *T*-2 E_S
67783:15	\[ in Texas law has a , \+ uh , what does it have *T*-1 , it has a \] death penalty does n't it ? E_S
67783:66	\[ in Texas law has a , \+ uh , what does it have *T*-1 , it has a \] death penalty does n't it ? E_S
67812:86	But , uh , \[ I , \+ I \] myself am in favor of it , uh , particularly for , uh , well I think 0 Texas has a \[ good , \+ good \] law . Uh , crimes , murders related with , uh , drugs or * killing a policemen . E_S
67902:34	* \[ to , \+ uh , to \] kill somebody is what it amounts to *T*-2 . E_S
67937:113	Well now \[ any , \+ uh , just * believe 0 in just about any \] state in the union , uh , uh , a \[ death , \+ uh , or , uh , yeah , death \] verdict is an automatic , uh , appeal . E_S
68062:32	and it seems *-1 to be getting tougher as time goes by . E_S
68064:6	My husband has n't quit , yet . E_S
68193:29	and one year of * ironing only once a week is not long enough for it to last . E_S
68289:60	I thought 0 that was the point of , uh , a unanimous jury was the idea that if everyone agrees then there should n't be any reasonable doubt . E_S
68406:6	the problem is 0 I ca n't guarantee that a judge would \[ be \+ necessarily be \] much better than a jury , E_S
68424:21	I guess 0 the judge 's time is worth too much , though . E_S
68441:39	\[ \[ you , \+ you , \] \+ somebody 's \] life is in twelve people 's hands E_S
68455:6	Neither side wants that . E_S
68788:37	the fartherest south 0 I 've been *T*-1 on the East Coast is Charlotte . E_S
68799:4	Charleston is a really nice place 0 * to visit *T*-1 . E_S
68801:26	\[ My , \+ uh , my \] sister lives in Charlotte E_S
68955:18	uh , my , uh , sister lives on Lake , Norman , just , N_S
69055:16	you know , the Aquarium is one of those things that , you know , because everybody , N_S
69123:46	And , you know , \[ the , \+ the \] problem in the work place is \[ that , \+ that \] people are , N_S
69124:13	like if your boss is your drinking buddy or whatever , I mean , you can \[ come to , \+ come to \] work *-1 drunk and get in an accident E_S
69126:8	and , nobody knows about it , E_S
69154:40	I do n't know that I believe 0 every secretary in every company needs *-1 to be *?* *-2 . E_S
69161:42	and , so , I really do n't care one way or another if anybody wants *-1 to pull me up tomorrow and test me . Because I have nothing 0 * to worry about *T*-2 . E_S
69325:75	and they can apparently test , um , back a certain period of time . Because MUMBLEx some of \[ the , \+ the \] residue ends up in your hair follicles , you know , E_S
69420:24	And , uh , a lot of my family is in Indiana . E_S
69439:34	Well my husband \[ has , \+ uh , on one side has \] an extended family , E_S
69809:49	The biggest problem \[ with , \+ with \] the weather and the rain in this area is the soil . E_S
69812:19	Oh . Is that what Dallas is *T*-1 , E_S
69816:38	You know , it 's not sandy like most of the state is *?* , E_S
69829:6	San Antonio has that same problem when the rains come *T*-1 . E_S
69861:94	and I thought oh , gee I 'm so glad *-2 to get out of there and get up here to the California Pacific coast where it rains *T*-1 and everything has flowers *T*-1 E_S
69954:21	But here , um , well the water is extremely cold , up here , E_S
69961:46	for some reason , because of the cold , uh , ocean , uh , water , the air is always cool . E_S
69977:8	and the air does n't feel anything like it does along the gulf coast region . E_S
69982:53	and we thought well , we 'll take advantage of it and see what all the Pacific coast is like *T*-1 . E_S
70008:18	Not like Texas where everything comes to a stand still *T*-1 . E_S
70030:4	Nothing seems quite as good . E_S
70234:13	This entire neighborhood , everybody keeps the places up real nice . E_S
70254:16	* Living in the city has some advantages . E_S
70304:9	Uh , landscaping is more , than the gardening , E_S
70337:6	My dad is a farmer E_S
70373:67	The only thing that *T*-1 saves it , with the schedule 0 I work *T*-2 and the schedule 0 my wife works *T*-3 , we 're getting ready *-4 to go to work at totally different times . So that . It 's not like we 're tripping over each other in the morning . E_S
70407:6	His mother comes in and says , why did you let him play in the dirt *T*-1 , E_S
70665:22	our biggest way of * saving money is then * to stop all these deductions , um , you know , is * to , N_S
70750:70	Well , I 'm sure that , uh , probably every person in this country would agree with you on that . Because everybody has a different idea of where the money should go *T*-1 . E_S
70764:23	Uh , I guess 0 my particular beef is that * having participated in the \[ mi- , \+ military \] off and on \[ over the , \+ over the \] years of *-2 being called *-1 back and things of that nature , is , uh , I 've found that , you know , there 's an extraordinary amount of waste . E_S
70774:64	why \[ \[ I , \+ I 'm , \] \+ I 'm \] a little concerned about *T*-2 today is that this , uh , \[ rather , uh , quick \[ and , \+ and \] easy , \+ I do n't know , I should n't say easy , rather quick \] victory \[ in the , \+ \[ in , \+ in \] the , \] uh , Mideast , uh , uh , over the , uh , Iraqis , uh , might lead us into , uh , a false sense *ICH*-1 of security that we can do that against any other foe . E_S
70784:74	and one of the things 0 we were told *T*-1 is , like , 0 they had eleven thousand HARM missiles which T I is the sole supplier for *T*-2 , E_S
70825:43	So \[ tho- , \+ those \] are two areas in which T I stands *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] gain \[ some , \+ some \] short term business 0 *T*-2 to restock that *T*-3 . E_S
70874:33	* Sounds like the way 0 the federal and state system works now *T*-1 . E_S
71065:33	Or you sneak out in the morning after daylight savings time starts and with your cup of coffee and see if it has grown overnight . E_S
71208:9	maybe this climate is a little better . E_S
71215:6	our favorite is something called * white half runner green beans , E_S
71239:6	my mother picks them when they 're fat *T*-1 E_S
71253:6	The flavor is better I think 0 *T*-2 in between . E_S
71267:11	Well , my mother does n't think 0 they have any flavor the way 0 I cook them *T*-1 . E_S
71397:6	the weather is wonderful , E_S
71508:15	my step classes and toning is about the only thing E_S
71527:10	and your whole body aches , you know . E_S
71710:16	I think 0 my wife has some . E_S
71736:107	If you do n't have one that *T*-1 's fun , and \[ not enjoy it , look , \+ not acting like she 's enjoying \] what she 's doing *T*-2 , the class is not going *-4 to get out , uh , what they should get *T*-3 out of the class . E_S
71784:78	like if you 're going too slow it will say , my grandmother could do this faster than you . And stuff like , a turtle goes faster E_S
71857:69	\[ there , \+ there 's \] \[ no , \+ no \] question 0 \[ the , \+ the \] end result is great E_S
71898:18	I guess 0 the biggest one is number of women in the work force . E_S
71931:27	Uh , I 'm not sure what the future holds *T*-1 for that E_S
72006:26	\[ When , \+ when \] your wife has her baby *T*-1 , is she going *-2 to stay home E_S

72559:18	I know 0 the whole situation is bad up here , E_S
72633:61	because , uh , even today where people are so illiterate and they go off to school and really nothing happens *T*-1 , I mean , they do n't learn anything . E_S
72657:27	and I think that that 's why reading is so important *T*-1 , E_S
72702:48	So , sometimes , uh , especially * traveling with T I , you know , everything goes on American Express , E_S
72713:25	But , uh , as far as personal life goes , I guess , 0 I really try *-1 to use them as little as possible , uh , E_S
72818:29	But that 's the one that your call center manager sees *T*-1 every month , E_S

73652:51	I guess 0 if this is the only place 0 you 've lived *T*-1 , Lubbock is a lot different than Dallas . E_S
73662:23	I mean , here in Dallas everything is just real rush , rush . E_S
73666:18	and * living in the city is a whole different uh , social structure E_S
73857:20	uh , E_S the pressures of drug is so much , E_S
73858:6	the prevalence is so much greater , E_S
73873:18	I think 0 the other thing is that , uh , we have taken some rather drastic turns \[ in our , \+ in our \] education and the way 0 we approach things *T*-1 as of maybe starting back \[ when , \+ when \] I 'm number one , you know , and , uh , uh , uh , * worrying about self and not , uh , seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family *T*-2 . E_S
73904:27	and you can see exactly , why the child is that way *T*-1 . E_S
73947:12	Of course , life is a lot more complicated too in ways ,
74000:8	just the volume makes a big difference , E_S
74056:38	uh , uh , I find 0 * working in a high school is very helpful because it lets me be a little more tolerant and understanding of what people do *T*-1 , E_S
74166:24	And what do you think 0 that problem is *T*-1 ? E_S
74293:134	so \[ it 's very , \+ it *EXP*-2 's very \] difficult * to say that this teacher is doing a better job than this other one , other than I guess \[ how , \+ you kn- , how \] a person scores *T*-1 in the beginning before the class and then after the class . E_S
74310:52	\[ I do n't think 0 student , \+ I do n't think 0 student \] teaching is enough . E_S
74346:18	and it happens that the teacher is an instructor who *T*-2 is in New York while Jimmy 's in Rome . E_S
74389:96	And then the states that *T*-2 either do n't adopt on a state wide basis or do n't have as many kids , just have *-3 to follow along and take what Texas gets *T*-1 . E_S
74393:7	MUMBLEx California is the biggest for elementary schools E_S
74593:6	the house is about , um , I 'd say *RNR*-1 almost thirty years old . E_S
74657:65	that 's one of the things 0 we 've been fortunate with *T*-1 , is 0 our , uh , wiring is okay . E_S
74664:8	but our plumbing is awful . E_S
74670:10	so if something breaks , we have *-1 to shut it off from the main , in the street , you know , E_S
74686:6	the power makes it run . E_S
74876:6	Your house sounds like mine because mine 's pier and beam too . E_S
74989:22	Uh , I think 0 T V has a lot 0 *T*-1 to do with the changes , too . Do n't you ?
75303:65	I live in a little suburb , uh , which *T*-1 \[ is , \+ I guess 0 *T*-2 from Dallas is \] twelve miles or so E_S
75408:8	The real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place *T*-1 . E_S
75533:28	But , uh , you know , basically the guy commits , you know three major crimes \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ uh , and \] car theft on top of it , destroys my car , E_S
75545:20	and , you know , the guy gets out in two months E_S
75556:21	\[ What , \+ what \] deterrent does he really have *T*-1 ? E_S
75646:69	And I think 0 one of the big things that you can do *T*-1 \[ is , \+ *-2 to increase deterrence is , \] uh , if someone is found *-3 guilty of a , uh , felony level offense , they lose their citizenship . E_S
75712:59	and , as you probably heard \[ from the , \+ in the \] Dallas and Texas area period the housing market is just unreal . E_S
75730:6	the thing is , uh , 0 when we moved in *T*-1 they had just , uh , painted , \[ wallpa- , \+ we 're , you know , wallpapered , \]
75987:11	every spring my mom says 0 we 're going *-1 to have \[ a par- , \+ a barbecue \] and tell everybody , * guess what , E_S
76289:46	I remember 0 I had a college professor who *T*-1 once said that genius is one percent inspiration , and ninety-nine percent perspiration . E_S
76398:8	the denial mechanism is really strong E_S
76412:10	and my other son is a senior in high school , E_S
76425:42	\[ but , \+ but \] you have *-1 to say at what point is n't the help becoming negative *T*-2 . E_S
76449:37	and , uh , it *EXP*-1 's too bad that all this stuff is just being thrown *-2 into a data base , and that none of the ideas or thoughts are being used *-3 at all . E_S
76517:41	And , \[ \[ the \+ the , \] \+ the \] skating rink does the rest practically , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S
76567:6	The weather is divine . E_S
76632:9	Uh , mother is my best friend , in Virginia . E_S
76725:13	And , uh , Tina enjoys , uh , the other lady , real well . E_S
76783:4	Enid is , uh , N_S
76794:9	Well , Enid is , not , uh , an unknown little city . E_S
76847:6	The weather is wonderful . E_S
76890:6	The moss grows , on the trees in the woods up MUMBLEx , eight , ten , feet . E_S
77081:32	But I think 0 with the way 0 the future is , um , economy wise *T*-1 , E_S
77186:61	See \[ \[ I , \+ I never , \] \+ I \] do n't even know what day care is really all about *T*-1 because \[ I , \+ I \] never went to a day care center , E_S
77323:81	Well , we did go to things like aquariums and , uh , uh , natural history museums and zoos , and all of those things that one does *T*-1 with kids ,
77416:28	And , uh , uh , granted 0 the child does n't always think that they 're sharing it , E_S but it , N_S
77544:56	and that 's part of , I think 0 *T*-2 , teaching too , is what a family is like *T*-1 , E_S
77547:7	Well everyone makes its own model , E_S
77826:20	\[ so . \+ So \] television is my main new source . E_S
77887:27	and , uh , uh , \[ the other one is , \+ uh , uh , her husband is \] in the \[ m- , \+ Navy \] E_S

77906:56	Washington , it really is \[ a , \+ uh , uh , an \] international city , where Baltimore is hometown Baltimore . E_S
77973:25	but \[ those are ni- , \+ Germantown is a nice \] area . E_S
77993:23	but , uh , now \[ my daughter ha- , \+ they have \] probably been carpooling together , in fact , E_S
78002:22	I do n't know what the situation is *T*-1 , E_S
78247:6	and diving is something that , N_S
78339:76	and I would like *-1 to maybe not take great long trips , \[ but , \+ but \] have your home base , where your home is *T*-2 and then just travel out for , like , maybe , oh , a month , maybe go , N_S
78363:99	But , uh , up the coast , uh , \[ at , \+ uh , uh , in \] Maryland and around there , \[ where the , \+ where the \] early history is *T*-1 , there 's some N_S
78364:40	Johnstown and , uh , \[ in s- , \+ in that \] area is just really neat , E_S
78403:14	Well , now , camping is fun with kids . E_S
78477:8	But the problem is , that I am very liberal politically E_S
78525:10	the big Republican thing is that \[ they do n't , \+ they vote \] for less government , E_S
78750:48	Um , well a lot of people , they 'll vote the way 0 their family votes *T*-1 , you know , E_S
78833:14	I think 0 everybody does , E_S
79029:11	now an additional thing is , uh , N_S
79245:21	\[ th- , \+ the \] dog is Joey ? E_S
79249:6	The cat is , N_S
79518:16	Joey , on the other hand is a little different . E_S

79636:6	my husband does . E_S
79692:8	the interest rate is so high that you 're really , N_S

80237:20	they 've come up that running is not as good for you as they thought 0 it was *?* . E_S
80414:44	Well \[ we only have on- , \+ only one \] of our bathroom has a window in it E_S
80569:24	Oh , well I hope 0 your project turns out great E_S
80581:32	I guess 0 we 'd better go because our time looks like it 's about up . E_S
80641:18	I think 0 C N N does a pretty good job . E_S
80731:10	The San Francisco paper is just wretched . E_S

80763:18	That 's a pretty decent paper is n't it *?* E_S
80791:63	\[ \[ I , \+ I think 0 I , \] \+ I \] agree with you that the problem seems *-1 to be 0 they do n't have enough time 0 * to do all the stuff *T*-2 . E_S

80902:8	my little girl is three months old E_S
80998:15	And , uh , my husband is a movie fanatic . E_S
81133:6	Julia Roberts is good . E_S
81245:9	Well Arsenio Hall is the one that *T*-1 jumped up and said that I ca n't believe 0 they killed them E_S
81275:8	And one bathroom is at the end of one side E_S
81287:6	every room leads to three rooms , E_S
81408:22	\[ And , \+ and \] WORKING GIRL is really good . E_S
81429:19	Well Carol since today 's subject is our homes , E_S
81436:18	and of course , the Plano area is basically with alleyways , E_S
81476:17	But the one thing , my house is a little bit different E_S
81484:15	And , uh , the kitchen is norm E_S
81502:24	Well it 's like when my son goes \[ up into the , \+ up into the \] furnace area over the garage *T*-1 . E_S
81578:14	I mean the fence is right there , E_S
81713:11	Uh , North Carolina is all the way on the east coast . E_S
81734:20	they do n't know what snow is *T*-1 . E_S
81783:6	and traffic slows down to nothing . E_S
81816:43	Now of course , \[ there 's , \+ you know , T I is \] here , Oscar Mayer E_S
81852:23	Well , they 're burning that diesel fuel is what it is *T*-1 . E_S
82066:23	You know what the best indoor purifying plant is *T*-1 for smoke and stuff ? E_S

82131:11	but then my brother-in-law works there , E_S
82157:8	well Boston is New York , is n't it ? E_S
82535:14	I mean your husband is not getting *-1 to spend as much time *ICH*-2 at home as he 'd want *-3 to *?* . E_S
82698:4	God knows why we hold it on Tuesdays *T*-1 . E_S
82754:6	New Hampshire is fairly easy E_S
82786:8	The motivational factor is probably ... E_S
82866:4	Everybody seems disappointed , E_S
82900:8	but the idea is * to get the individual to the polls ,
82912:77	\[ And , \+ eh , and , \] eh , \[ y- , \+ \] no matter what \[ a , \+ a , \] candidate promises *T*-2 during the campaign , \[ i- , \+ \] which *T*-1 is n't very much , specif- , N_S
82957:61	I mean , I think 0 \[ you \+ , you \] still have a view that the American voter is different from other voters . E_S
82972:19	I do n't think 0 England has *?* , E_S
82973:14	I think 0 England has about a seventy percent , sixty-five percent turn out . E_S
82986:69	But , simply because people were so concerned about their inability \[ that \+ \[ to , \+ \] that \] their vote does not count any way .
82999:45	\[ But \+ \[ th- , \+ \] but , \] you know , everything is relative to when , uh , eh , \[ w-w- , \+ you know , we \] had higher turnouts *T*-1 because at that time we \[ cur- , \+ \] talk about the turnout relative to the eligible voter , right ? E_S
83011:7	Now everybody is available . E_S
83075:32	but usually by this time they tell me that the time is up . E_S
83086:64	Uh , I know 0 in some cases now in some states , depending on the criminal code , uh , a unanimous verdict is not required *-1 . E_S
83132:96	And the eighteen years will , uh , translate into something like , uh , four point seven , \[ \[ if every , \+ if the , \] \+ if the \] prisoner is a model prisoner , E_S
83241:31	The benefit , I guess 0 *T*-2 , of crime outweighs what the deterrent is *T*-1 . E_S
83241:44	The benefit , I guess 0 *T*-2 , of crime outweighs what the deterrent is *T*-1 . E_S
83253:33	\[ so has our , \+ I guess 0 our population has \] grown some too . E_S
83276:80	I mean \[ that , \+ it \] seems to me \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ that \] when a jury makes a decision *T*-1 , they should not be asked *-2 , uh , before television cameras and newspaper reporters how they reached that decision *T*-3 . E_S
83310:23	It was like , well , a picture is not good enough . E_S
83758:9	Because the porch is pretty big , E_S
83827:47	About the only \[ bloom , \+ bulb \] that *T*-1 repeats well in my area is the , uh , uh , daffodil and some of the narcissus bulb . E_S
83870:8	And our neighborhood is a planned development with , I think , 0 it is *RNR*-1 seven hundred and fifty-five families . E_S
83945:10	After the bloom dies , they are not pretty . E_S
83996:24	The whole , uh , perimeter bordering the house is all in Texas wildflower beds . E_S
84010:96	\[ I am wanting bl- , \+ I want blue \] and purple and , you know , just different shades of that . Because \[ my , \+ my \] house is gray , E_S
84106:36	Its \[ \[ p- , \+ p- , \] \+ proper \] name is Gomphrena . E_S
84123:11	How big a city is Rome *T*-1 ? E_S
84127:9	Well , Rome is pretty small . E_S
84192:6	And Dallas is pretty , uh , E_S
84288:22	I do not know what the world is *T*-1 or is not *T*-1 .
84311:16	I think 0 T V is bad . Because they , uh , show all sorts of violence on , N_S
84352:22	It is an attitude like the world owes them something . E_S
84396:10	And the Air Force is one of the \[ bitter , \+ better \] \[ \[ \[ military , \+ supposedly m- , \] \+ m- , \] \+ military \] experiences . E_S
84425:23	you know , at least the Air Force is , N_S
84466:8	But the crime is so bad there . E_S
84532:8	And my husband is the kind of guy , 0 \[ he 's , \+ *T*-1 he 's \] sometime , N_S
84611:18	I think 0 our justice system needs *-1 to be stricter . I mean , because \[ everyone , \+ they \] do it E_S
84619:30	I do not know how the New York state prison system is *T*-1 E_S
84680:14	my ten year old nephew says things that he is aware of *T*-1 that I am just going , Michael , how did you hear about that *T*-2 *T*-3 ? E_S
84722:80	Well , Wayne , I , uh , feel very strongly about parents doing things with their children , and making time available even sometimes when time is n't available *T*-1 . E_S
84777:127	And we could , uh , read the things in the history books and understand what they said *T*-1 , when it was like , \[ we need food , \+ we need *-2 to raise food \] quickly because this place gets very cold very soon *T*-3 . E_S
84821:8	And the wife says , Well , you need something 0 * to do *T*-1 , E_S
84892:11	Uh , car pollution seems *-1 to be the one and only thing \[ that , \+ that \] I can really put my finger on *T*-2 here . E_S
84895:25	And \[ the , \+ the \] transportation situation is such that , uh , all the car pollution \[ is , \+ is \] absolutely awful . E_S
84975:61	Well , I guess 0 \[ \[ the fur- , \+ the , \] \+ to me the first \] thing is 0 I wish 0 society would get as upset about this as you do get *?* , * getting people upset about animal rights . E_S
85013:15	and * passing the law depends on how heavy \[ the car industry , \+ the automobile lobby \] is *T*-1 . E_S
85029:51	\[ \[ \[ That , \+ that , \] \+ the , \] \+ the \] smell is awful E_S
85086:25	But with the pollution issue , uh , fossil fuel is not the way 0 * to go *T*-1 anyway . E_S
85129:6	And California seems *-1 to be taking steps , E_S
85413:11	Most of Virginia is clay . E_S
85436:14	well , uh , Texas is a big state E_S
85473:23	Uh , not too much of northern Virginia is like that anymore . E_S
85568:164	Um , E_S \[ I think \+ I mean , \[ if , \+ if \] I start \] this I just wanted *-1 to say that , um , one of the things that I do n't think 0 we really understood *T*-2 about \[ the , \+ the \] middle eastern situation is that they 're a totally different type of people than we are *?* , E_S
85570:26	and their idea of what *T*-1 is justice is totally different from ours . E_S
85582:30	And also , um , you know , the other thing is 0 \[ their idea , \+ or our \[ ide- , \+ idea \] \] of democracy has nothing 0 * to do *T*-1 with them . E_S
85582:82	And also , um , you know , the other thing is 0 \[ their idea , \+ or our \[ ide- , \+ idea \] \] of democracy has nothing 0 * to do *T*-1 with them . E_S
85590:57	And , so , you know , * trying *-1 to put like a square peg in a round hole is just , you know , N_S
85619:6	the war has certainly sort of set things on end over there E_S
85690:8	And his wife is so godly
85706:32	And \[ it 's , \+ you know , everything is \] to the glory of Allah , E_S
85776:112	I think that \[ the , \+ the \] answer may lie \[ in , \+ uh , not in \] so much a , uh , national kind of medical thing that li- , like 0 England has *T*-1 but more of a , um , national insurance , uh , sort of clearinghouse or whatever . E_S
85788:198	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] think that *ICH*-3 , uh , again *-2 having gone through a period when I was out of work and had *-1 to buy health insurance on my own *T*-4 , if you do n't have a company \[ supporting you in the , \+ \] uh , picking up the major portion of your health insurance , the cost is \[ p- , \+ almost prohibitive . \] E_S
85805:33	I do n't know what the total cost of the program is *T*-1 E_S
85823:26	or one of , whatever the type name is *T*-1 , H M O , uh , \[ where the , \+ uh , where \] you go to the doctor and it only costs you ten dollars and the insurance picks up the rest *T*-3 . If you tried *-2 to buy something like that , \[ I 'm prob- , \+ it would probably \] be five or six hundred dollars a month for just the cost of something . E_S
85823:121	or one of , whatever the type name is *T*-1 , H M O , uh , \[ where the , \+ uh , where \] you go to the doctor and it only costs you ten dollars and the insurance picks up the rest *T*-3 . If you tried *-2 to buy something like that , \[ I 'm prob- , \+ it would probably \] be five or six hundred dollars a month for just the cost of something . E_S
85882:76	It 's really nice because \[ \[ \[ they , \+ th- , \] \+ you know , their , \] \+ their \] attitude is different \[ than , \+ than \] a regular , uh , \[ insurance , \+ uh , health insurance , \] uh , \[ the , \+ \] \[ in , \+ in \] a , H M O , you know , E_S
86032:14	Uh , well my husband is French E_S
86482:10	Smith and Wesson revolver is n't going *-1 to do you much good . E_S
86575:25	anyway , E_S I think 0 if somebody shoots somebody , they ought *-1 to be shot *-1 . E_S
86592:54	\[ \[ The , \+ uh , the , \] \+ again the \] purpose of gun control is * to control how it is being used *-3 *T*-2 is what the purpose should be *T*-1 . E_S
86618:6	not everybody needs a gun E_S
86685:13	and now the young boy wants *-1 to know E_S
86927:31	It 's like , you know , hey , everybody has *-1 to be free *-2 to do their own thing . E_S
86946:9	Well , nobody feels responsibility * to do something . E_S
86975:8	And the sacrifice is not that great . E_S
86990:14	Well , \[ Texas has , \+ uh , Texas \[ has , \+ uh , has \] \] always struck me , N_S
87050:26	I mean , because you know everybody is so active with their kids and all that . E_S
87081:137	so , uh , by the time 0 we got around , uh , to each of us and it was time again *T*-1 , we were almost tired , you know . Um , partly because , um , \[ wh- , \+ \] gourmet cooking is not particularly conducive for regular dining . E_S

87592:5	everyone thinks 0 taxes are too high I 'm sure 0 *T*-1 . E_S
87709:10	and the other thing is that \[ when it , \+ when \] \[ it 's , \+ the public transportation is \] established *-3 that early on *T*-1 \[ then , \+ then \] the \[ business , \+ uh , business \] and residential patterns develop *-2 to take advantage of that . E_S

89345:48	Whatever you ask or scream *T*-1 when I 'm on the phone *T*-2 , the answer is no . E_S
89426:83	Well because , I know 0 \[ our , \+ our \] little house over here stuck * in the middle of , you know , the subdivision is , I think fifty five , E_S
89427:22	so , I think 0 the high end is definitely , you know somewhere there . E_S
89432:9	because this house has around thirty four hundred square feet , E_S
89515:37	We have got three different levels of decking , because , this lot slopes way back down E_S
89566:50	And I was thinking , well , you know , I know why your God damn bill is so high *T*-1 , E_S
89601:9	well the topic is * selecting care for the elderly . E_S
89785:10	As the situation is so sad because it just takes all the dignity away \[ from , \+ from \] people who *T*-1 have been independent all their lives . E_S
89799:42	And oh \[ I , \+ I \] do not know what the answer is *T*-1 , E_S
90016:15	and , uh , my sister-in-law lives in Chicago , E_S
90018:6	this guy is , you know , from here . E_S
90059:19	I mean , because Tom Wolfe is so perceptive , when it comes to , you know , * pinpointing , uh , \[ \[ so- , \+ so- , \] \+ society 's \] ills and , things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things *T*-1 E_S
90114:6	my son is learning disabled , E_S
90205:30	And I kept *-1 saying to the teacher , something is wrong here . E_S
90206:4	Something is wrong here . E_S
90228:25	and I said , you know , something is wrong , E_S
90245:69	and we think 0 he needs *-1 to be tested *-2 immediately , because , you know , once the first report card comes in , they , have all these people being tested * , E_S
90327:8	and their attitude is , `` I 'm a bad boy , ''
90388:74	\[ the , \+ \] in fact , they 've had cases *ICH*-1 in the past where parents have committed suicide because their child has not gotten into the top kindergarten , which *T*-2 means 0 they probably wo n't get into the top elementary \[ and , \+ and \] high school *T*-3 , E_S
90407:8	The other thing is that the priority in the family is that child 's education , and is that child . E_S
90407:29	The other thing is that the priority in the family is that child 's education , and is that child . E_S
90424:6	the child is very bright , E_S
90440:34	And so that 's why I said , 0 their childhood is extremely different from mine *T*-1 . E_S
90574:8	The only problem is that now , uh ,
90651:47	it 's just the way , you know , 0 I think 0 society is *T*-1 now , is that \[ we are not , \+ we do not \] have the extensive family 0 we used *-2 to *?* *T*-3 . E_S
90762:8	and the sister is in a nursing home , E_S
90794:15	But my area of expertise is , uh , uh , human computer interaction . E_S
90811:21	Well , you know , the thing is , 0 when you 're a kid *T*-2
90856:55	\[ because , \+ um one of the reasons is because , \] you know , the kid does n't know exactly what they want *T*-1 , E_S
90914:54	and \[ I do n't , \+ I think \] 0 because it costs less , the kid does n't take it quite as serious , you know , E_S
90924:33	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 the bad part is that most parents or kids do n't know what * to look for *T*-1 . E_S
91029:97	\[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 another thing that *T*-1 concerns me is , uh , 0 \[ so many people , \+ \] it seems like everybody today is still in that MUMBLEx job market E_S
91352:8	The first issue does n't come out until next year , E_S
91368:18	um , most of the stuff is on , uh , literary criticism and philosophy , and religion and all that . E_S
91398:29	I mean \[ the , \+ the \] copyright is nineteen ninety-one , E_S
91586:33	Well , \[ all , \+ see , all \] the family lives in once place , except for a few of us are scattered about . E_S
91617:24	The first Sunday in October , the Jordan family gets together . E_S
91642:17	A lot of the older family lives in Vernon . E_S
91679:21	\[ Every , \+ every \] family brings \[ a , \+ a \] dish of some kind , E_S
91713:69	Do they always have \[ the , \+ the \] one person in the family who \[ * knows , or \+ everyone thinks 0 *T*-4 they know \] how * to make this the best *T*-3 , so that 's what they get *-1 to cook *T*-2 . E_S
91764:75	the organize \[ the , \+ \] you know , who *T*-1 is going *-2 to see to it that the coffee pot gets there , who *T*-3 's going *-4 to rent the tables , who *T*-5 's going *-6 to see to it that the silverware gets turned *-7 back to the caterer . E_S
91797:21	Uh , you know , my son keeps in touch with him , I think 0 *T*-1 , E_S
91910:70	The only thing that \[ I , \+ I \] visited *T*-1 that , you know , *T*-2 is quite a tourist spot is Cancun , Mexico . E_S
92074:77	and \[ \[ it was , \+ it 's really , \] \+ it 's \] sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are *T*-1 *T*-2 E_S
92112:4	Canada is very nice . E_S
92209:25	I guess 0 that 's what retirement is all about *T*-1 . E_S
92359:8	L A LAW is about the heaviest thing 0 I watch *T*-1 . E_S
92365:15	or , uh , Monday night is real good with me , you know ,
92368:13	That type of show is \[ what we \+ what , uh , we \] watch *T*-1 . E_S
92391:8	And what night is it on *T*-1 ? E_S
92437:18	and , of course , the town thinks 0 he 's just terrible , because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and he 's broken it . E_S
92438:71	And then we saw one \[ \[ where this , \+ there was a teenage , \] \+ when a teenage \] boy comes into his manhood *T*-1 , E_S
92460:94	\[ and , \+ and \] \[ wh- , \+ the \] relationship between the family \[ is , \+ is \] really \[ now , \+ now \] 0 the mother-in-law lives in the house with them . E_S
92501:8	but my husband likes *-1 to watch , um , old movies , especially war movies , \[ or , \+ or , \] uh , sports , which I 'm not , E_S
92593:29	\[ I , \+ I \] think that Plano has really done a fantastic job . E_S
92857:42	some people \[ are compl- , \+ now are complaining \] because the stuff is n't picked *-1 up at the curbside , you know , E_S
92981:66	I think 0 * *EXP*-1 is a \[ good , \+ good \] example , you know , that even , industry is willing *-2 to do it . E_S
93048:15	but , uh , my favorite is \[ the , \+ the \] indulgent ones , where we go off \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , see places that *T*-1 have interested me since I was a kid , for the most part *T*-2 . E_S
93054:6	Your family does n't live close , then ? E_S
93150:16	And then when the ship docks *T*-1 , you get *-2 to go *-3 sight-seeing and shopping . E_S
93276:20	Oh , that 's what everybody says *T*-1 , E_S
93288:10	But the ordinary thing is * to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of Texas in the summer E_S
93304:6	and everybody is really interesting , E_S
93305:6	and everybody is there *-1 to have a good time E_S
93344:6	Our son-in-law is from Panama . E_S
93352:8	And his father is \[ a , \+ a \] doctor E_S
93353:8	and his mother is a kindergarten teacher , E_S
93541:28	something as simple as a walk with my wife is very enjoyable . E_S
93547:51	\[ \[ that , \+ that \] \+ during that \] time the stress from the day goes away . E_S
93573:48	During those first few months you have *-1 to think about running and why your elbow hurts *T*-2 and why you ca n't breathe *T*-3 and this and that , E_S
93585:42	\[ the ex- , \+ the , uh , weight lifting \] on the other hand is actually , you know , N_S
93593:8	and my wife thinks the same thing *ICH*-1 about both me and herself that * get that little bit of definition in your muscles \[ is , \+ is \] attractive E_S
93692:11	When your life becomes sedentary *T*-1 is when you have *-2 to make yourself a plan *T*-3 , E_S
93852:6	My mother likes *-1 to serve taco grandes . E_S
93991:34	the ground turkey , \[ it 's , \+ \] the meat is softer E_S
93993:4	everybody seems *-1 to like it . E_S
94013:30	and I do n't think 0 anybody in my house knows the difference , unless you tell them . E_S
94134:51	of course , over the years it has , uh , built up as far as the organization is concerned E_S
94148:6	and everyone brings in food E_S
94239:15	my side of the family is from back in Ohio and West Virginia , E_S
94358:12	So , the officer idea is a good idea . E_S
94401:34	The biggest problem , well , like in this part of town seems *-1 to be the attitude and the atmosphere in the schools that , uh , you know , you can throw money at it , E_S
94431:63	\[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I , \] \+ I \] think that the biggest problem is , uh , \[ with the , \+ uh , with the \] home environment being part of it . E_S
94449:21	and it 's just like , everybody likes *-1 to blame everything on drugs now , E_S
94583:38	Well , I , myself , really feel like the structured day care program is more successful *ICH*-1 in today 's environment than the one on one care is *?* . E_S
94583:77	Well , I , myself , really feel like the structured day care program is more successful *ICH*-1 in today 's environment than the one on one care is *?* . E_S
94622:296	* seeing the children in the school the way 0 I do *T*-1 , \[ \[ I , \+ I mean , I see the ones that , \] \+ we can always tell the ones that \] *T*-2 have not been around children at all when they come in as three year olds *T*-6 as opposed to the ones that *T*-3 have been in the program , that *T*-4 started at twelve months maybe , and \[ were \+ were \] even in there one day a week which *T*-5 is all 0 our school provides *T*-7 \[ for the , \+ you know for the \] under three year olds E_S
94669:119	however , uh , when it came to * hiring and staffing people who *T*-1 cared and who *T*-2 were willing *-3 to take care of those children and spend that kind of time *T*-4 , the pay is minimal E_S
95045:11	Uh , neither one has a modem , E_S
95112:6	What time is it *T*-2 now where you are *T*-1 ? E_S
95196:31	Do you think 0 \[ you \+ \] D Base is more flexible or allows you to do more . E_S
95247:45	and I think 0 \[ if , \+ if , \] uh , an employer feels that he wants *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] drug test employees and they do n't like it , then they should not be employed *-2 there . E_S
95266:9	unless an employer has a reason *-1 to believe that \[ his , \+ \] uh , the work competency \[ of , \+ of \] the \[ employ- , \+ employee \] \[ is , \+ is \] hurting the business . E_S
95288:22	\[ But , \+ but \] my concern is , uh , school bus drivers . E_S
95340:9	Now T I has the random testing policy E_S
95476:49	So I 'm curious especially since T I -s a local , you know , employer is also already doing it , * seeing what they 'll say *T*-1 about it especially since , N_S
95521:16	I think that an employer has the right * to ask you *-1 to do anything , E_S
95566:161	I just , uh , spent whatever *T*-1 came in \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , \[ didn- , \+ never knew \] what *T*-2 came in and what *T*-3 went out . But , uh , \[ just , you know , like , \+ about like \] the government runs . E_S
95656:17	And a similar hotel in Paris is two hundred dollars a night now . E_S
95694:8	and our daughter watches her pennies so closely , that \[ she almost , \+ she almost , \] just sounds like your father , E_S
95697:48	I mean , she has everything planned *-1 so closely , that if , something goes wrong , it just throws her for a loop . E_S
95777:6	My wife is still in school *-1 getting her doctorate , E_S
95789:6	our son has a year left * E_S
95934:51	\[ as far as , \+ \] \[ maybe , \+ maybe \] as the summer heat comes along I would sort of like *-1 going somewhere where it 's not so hot *T*-2 . And being able *-3 to be outside , enjoy \[ outsor- , \+ outside \] activities , E_S
95943:6	the beach is great . E_S
95944:6	A pool is great . E_S
96000:10	and the , beach is nice , E_S
96007:7	the beach is really nice , is n't it *?* . E_S
96339:83	And , uh , uh , I guess 0 \[ \[ \[ my , \+ I , \] uh , the one , \] \+ my one \] bad thing is \[ that I am , \+ that I wish \] 0 my mother had had some of those opportunities , because , I think 0 \[ she would have really , \+ she rea- , would have \] succeeded in a lot of ways , \[ that men , \+ that women \] were not able *-1 to succeed *T*-2 , in her , generation . E_S
96565:23	but , at home , uh , the recorder gets my calls . E_S
96693:35	well * \[ even , \+ even \] raising boys today is different though , because , they are expected *-1 to do so much more than they used *-2 to *?* . E_S
96926:11	And actually , today is really \[ the first , \+ as far as I am concerned *-1 , the first \] day of summer . Because we have had so much going on the past few weeks . E_S
97070:28	and when \[ her , \+ her \] family comes to her and says , * fix this *T*-1 , you know , E_S
97092:17	every single person in this family expects me to get , N_S
97119:11	because , the mediator is an unbiased bystander who , N_S
97167:12	in fact my situation is a little bit strange , E_S
97239:16	And only when the infant screams *T*-1 , are they going *-2 to go there , E_S
97256:22	Well , such as things for learning gives the child stimulation 0 I think 0 *T*-1 is important . E_S
97269:35	and there 's times of day that even when the child is awake *T*-1 \[ that they , \+ that they \] lay quietly and look at certain things E_S
97387:11	right now the situation is so tight at many places , that it *EXP*-1 's even hard * to have a choice . E_S
97460:131	and * \[ have , \+ have \] some kind of real good program , set *-1 up so that \[ you , \+ when you \] go *T*-2 you can be assured that if there 's an emergency that person in charge knows C P R or first aid E_S
97472:6	my daughter does not seem *-1 to be on a real schedule yet , E_S
97493:4	society is geared to \[ a , \+ a \] day person E_S
97633:57	uh , I think 0 \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] the image that the woman has *T*-1 and , uh , in the world , as , uh , the lesser of the two . E_S
97653:19	So , that 's the main point is that we are going ahead . E_S
97754:45	even if they want *-1 to *?* , they are more comfortable when somebody is the boss *T*-2 . E_S
97769:83	\[ And , \+ uh , but \] I think that they should be in harmony with what they are *T*-1 , with what the subject matter is *T*-2 . E_S
97983:10	The five year old does n't have the attention span , either . E_S
98194:8	and our neighborhood is pretty much working class people , though I 'm in graduate school , uh , E_S
98222:24	\[ The \+ sort of on my end is *T*-1 more of the \] upper middle class E_S
98259:11	Well , the thing is , 0 I do n't , N_S
98273:57	\[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] \+ basically \[ the , \+ the \] problem is \] \[ within the , \+ in the \] society and the society 's views E_S
98305:40	\[ our , \+ uh , our \] mayor in , uh , Baltimore is one of the people that *T*-1 goes on national television and says 0 they should , uh , legalize drugs .

E_S
98335:13	well , the other side is that unfortunately some of the down side , N_S
98340:8	but the thing is , 0 if somebody ruined their life , uh , society did n't try *-1 to then save themselves from it , E_S
98381:4	crime is one of those things that *T*-1 's , uh , N_S
98424:45	But , you know , the other thing that *T*-1 bothers me in the crime is the , uh , N_S
98426:8	and drunk driving is a good one , E_S
98427:43	* is that people are well indoctrinated *-1 in their society that drunken driving is unacceptable . E_S
98436:165	In this country , and for example with alcohol or with drugs \[ is , \+ \] we do n't seem *-1 to understand how * to handle it as a society to say \[ okay , \+ it is okay \] under these circumstances , but if you step outside these bounds , the punishment is extreme *T*-2 .
98443:40	\[ That , \+ I think that , \] uh , the drunk driving has \[ just \+ actually , just \] caught on . E_S
98505:12	Well , see Maryland is one of the most , N_S
98534:38	and one thing that you get *T*-2 if you have some expertise is , uh , you know the range \[ of , \+ of \] possible values or terms or , you know , how heinous was the crime *T*-1 . E_S
98591:36	and so , when , uh , you or I as an individual gets on a jury *T*-1 we tend *-2 to have certain mental images of what *T*-3 's what because we see the headlines , uh , E_S
98600:22	\[ and , \+ and \] his attorney gets his \[ sentences , \+ sentencing \] reduced *-1 because he 's gone to a lesser charge , like , I do n't know what , assault or something or , N_S

98654:6	the oath is * to tell the truth , E_S
98676:22	\[ and , \+ and \] your occupation is teaching ? E_S
99045:9	Oh , Austin is so pretty . E_S
99065:65	And , uh , you know , *-1 having gone to the University of Minnesota , I know what a big university is like *T*-2 . E_S
99067:6	and Baylor has a band camp . E_S
99164:22	and I do feel fortunate that Texas has so many good schools . E_S
99194:28	Uh , what she talks about *T*-1 a lot is theater which I think 0 *T*-2 is , N_S
99249:6	this humidity has just really hung on there . E_S
99275:10	and , the earth opens up . E_S
99325:42	You probably know where that is *T*-1 because I know where Pontiac is *T*-2 , E_S
99403:31	\[ Lake , \+ I think 0 Lake \] Whitmore is the only one 0 I have real memories of *T*-1 . Which *T*-2 is , N_S
99543:6	our house is kind of on a little hill , E_S
99558:19	I mean , sometimes the ice is pretty bad , E_S
99958:15	but my , um , husband has an aunt who *T*-1 has been like a second mother , I mean always lived in the same town and took care of him and such . E_S
100012:46	So often I think though , 0 *T*-1 elderly people do n't realize that their diet is that bad . E_S
100131:35	And then if health \[ or , \+ or \] mental capacity deteriorates , they 're able *-1 to take the next steps without so much change E_S
100137:11	my aunt 's mother is , uh , gotten ill recently E_S
100301:58	I guess 0 \[ that 's MUMBLEx , my , \+ that 's something that my \] family has always believed strongly in *T*-1 , E_S
100463:38	gosh I 'm sure , 0 not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas E_S
100582:6	The home is the key . E_S
100592:32	and , uh , \[ the- , \+ the \] main goal is * making money now E_S
100607:40	\[ but , \+ but \] \[ that \+ the \] most important thing is still , you know * getting your education . E_S
100620:72	and \[ if , \+ if \] children come to school , yes , *-1 insecure and their \[ mo- , \+ \] biggest concern is survival both at home , N_S
100664:27	But , you know , part of my feeling is that if you \[ solve , \+ help \] them to work through their problems while they 're littler , then they wo n't have as many problems up there . E_S
100680:43	So they started , uh , *-1 dividing the kids up so that a counselor stays with her group of counselees \[ through \+ you know , through \] all three years of middle school . E_S
100707:29	\[ b- , \+ Because , \] uh , education is the key to our future E_S
100735:61	But , anyway , one of the key things was \[ that \+ that \] we believed that the public education is the best economic value . E_S
100740:47	Anyway , you know , the point was , what *T*-1 happens when public education fails *T*-2 ? E_S
100929:25	And what I liked *T*-1 about Preston Hollow is that the people that *T*-2 were there when Cheryl was two *T*-4 , which *T*-3 was fifteen years ago , many of them are still there today . E_S
101136:8	And the bank has a lot of programs *ICH*-1 now for child care referrals . E_S
101164:40	Well and I would think , you know , 0 since big business is supposedly why the government makes the decisions 0 they do *T*-1 *T*-2 you know , \[ the , \+ the \] people that *T*-3 work in big business have families E_S
101164:56	Well and I would think , you know , 0 since big business is supposedly why the government makes the decisions 0 they do *T*-1 *T*-2 you know , \[ the , \+ the \] people that *T*-3 work in big business have families E_S
101218:29	and my \[ future , \+ future \] sister-in-law 's mother does that too , full-time . E_S
101220:18	Well in Plano though the problem is 0 , you find , N_S
101323:21	My husband and I , our favorite meal is , uh , N_S
101432:6	My husband makes those . E_S
101447:18	But everyone else in my family does . E_S
101684:15	Um , and my other one does not . E_S
101714:17	And all that kind of stuff does really help . E_S
101721:6	My name is Nola . E_S
101869:125	I mean even if they had *-1 to pay more now , I mean in the long run it *EXP*-3 's going *-2 to cost society more * to force two people to work . Even though it 's higher productivity is short-term . E_S
101889:41	There are a lot of two parent , um , situations where the woman goes back to work because that 's what she wants *-1 to do *T*-2 *T*-3 , you know . E_S
101952:52	Well , I think 0 it 's going *-1 to , change in the homes before anything changes anywhere else . E_S
101959:6	The home is the base , E_S
101971:128	I know 0 \[ they do do some , \+ they do have some \] classes *ICH*-3 *ICH*-4 in , um , high schools and things for kids 0 *T*-1 to , uh , give them an idea of what family life is like *T*-2 \[ and the , \+ uh , you know , and , uh , that \] kind of thing E_S
102072:44	\[ Tha- , \+ that 's \] one of the things , a good pasta means a lot to me . E_S
102134:13	When a new restaurant opens up *T*-1 , they usually send out coupons . E_S
102479:58	Oh , so I went up *-1 to do WordPerfect cause that seems like that 's what everybody wants *T*-2 , E_S
102643:44	One of our favorite places here \[ in , \+ in \] the Dallas area is Atlantic Cafe . E_S
102686:8	Atlantic Cafe is down \[ on , \+ I believe 0 it 's on \] McKinney . E_S
102697:81	You know what we 'd really like *T*-1 , \[ if , \+ if \] we just have \[ a , \+ a \] casual evening is Houston 's . E_S
102705:8	The only thing is 0 you have *-1 to wait . E_S

103021:13	Uh , the air pollution is n't too bad in our area . E_S
103056:21	I think , uh , 0 air is n't as bad *ICH*-1 0 it once was *?* , from the cars , because we certainly have plenty of cars in our area . E_S
103111:26	So , I do n't know what the answer is *T*-1 . E_S
103120:6	my line gets some static . E_S
103146:70	\[ I do n't know what , \+ uh , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know what \] the problem is *T*-1 E_S
103191:59	But , uh , who *T*-1 knows what the future will hold *T*-2 . Uh , as far as energy goes , E_S
103268:27	no matter how rotten they were *T*-2 , somebody loves them . E_S
103318:8	and people crime is still climbing E_S
103366:23	And , uh , you know , nobody wants that . E_S
103382:22	I 'm not sure what their policy is *T*-1 on capital punishment E_S
103518:20	Well , my favorite type of music is classical music , E_S

103663:8	His middle name is Chris , or Christopher \[ for \+ for \] her daddy , E_S

103953:42	Just , * To see stacks and stacks of newspapers just to the trash is just amazing . E_S
103967:92	well I 'll have *-1 to say 0 \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm , \] the only one 0 I 'm good at *T*-2 at this point is the newspaper . Uh , * taking that to the Boy Scouts and my aluminum cans uh , * getting rid *-3 of those , E_S
103973:97	\[ but , \+ But , \] it just seems like on the larger scale that , you know , \[ the , \+ \] we always talk about *T*-1 in our society is that economic strife things E_S
104066:33	because really , when I look at what my grass does *T*-1 \[ in , \+ in \] actually about twenty-four hours *T*-3 , uh , *-4 knowing what the farmers do *T*-2 in rural areas ,
104115:30	on all \[ the , \+ the \] advertisements Arnold Schwarzenegger says 0 he does n't kill anybody in the movie . E_S
104229:13	and so THE LITTLE MERMAID is now our favorite movie . E_S
104276:6	the movie comes out quicker than you can go *-1 see it . Sometimes . E_S
104308:47	\[ I , \+ I \] know 0 we get discount tickets where my husband works *T*-1 , E_S

104335:6	and Bob follows him on vacation . E_S
104343:6	the house explodes ? E_S
104398:73	but , as far as a habit at the house , uh , I have n't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants *-2 to pick *T*-1 up . E_S
104408:81	But , \[ it , \+ it \] should be starting , I would stay probably in the next month \[ if , \+ if \] everything goes that , N_S
104558:6	GOOD HOUSEKEEPING is the one that *T*-1 kind of sets around for \[ when , \+ uh , when \] I 'm really have time and I really want *-2 to read something *T*-3 , you know . E_S
104707:20	but , then that kind of thinking is also tempered *-1 with \[ the , \+ the \] knowledge , or at least \[ the , \+ the \] rumor , I 'm not really sure if it 's true or not , that , uh , we 're not spending as much per , * let 's say *RNR*-2 , afflicted person on cancer . E_S
104713:4	AIDS has more money than , uh , breast cancer . E_S
104831:13	Uh , but my husband works E_S
104852:13	uh , N_S my job is 0 I 'm supervisor of personnel safety for the world 's largest paint company , E_S
104881:59	Well , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] unfortunate , I think 0 *T*-1 , that everyone does n't have that opinion . E_S
104939:15	but , uh , my brother-in-law happens *-1 to work there E_S
104961:22	I do n't know what the crime is like *T*-1 where you are *T*-2 , E_S
105071:26	but now I 've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me *T*-1 . E_S
105139:6	my husband travels a couple times a month E_S
105146:11	and uh , Disneyworld is the one for a week next year E_S
105191:20	but , uh , yours to Disneyworld sounds a little bit better . E_S
105552:42	it 's just a problem that \[ p- , \+ \] no one is sure just how * to handle *T*-2 *T*-1 I think 0 *T*-3 . E_S
105746:11	Well , my sister is the seamstress of the two of us . E_S
105759:6	And Cleveland is n't all as bad as what you 've heard *T*-1 . E_S
105830:8	and my wife is an A one cook , E_S
105920:45	But in the Addison , well about everything that you could want *T*-1 in Dallas is in the Addison area , anyway . E_S
105942:35	Also a great place that *T*-1 they have like Cajun food is Copelands . E_S
105970:8	Magic Time Machine is the place 0 you 're thinking of *T*-1 , E_S
106130:27	And \[ that , \+ the \] other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days , and would have *-1 to be hospitalized *-2 a day or two , E_S
106148:24	she needed somebody to watch her twenty-four hours a day . E_S
106204:37	but when she does *T*-1 \[ there , \+ \] a nurse is right there * to help her E_S
106592:8	the worst part is , 0 it 's the same color E_S
106933:49	Well , each time they used *-1 to call in and tell me 0 their space is limited and to please , uh , N_S
107108:6	recycled paper is actually very expensive . E_S
107188:6	my father has , uh , five sisters and two brothers E_S
107189:8	and my mother has four brothers and two sisters . E_S
107217:8	and my family is from Ohio E_S
107380:44	I guess 0 we 've kind of covered our subject matter , since neither one is really into gardening , are we *?* ? E_S
107465:8	the only thing is 0 if they do n't vote , they have no right * to complain . E_S
107635:8	and my mom has *-1 to take care of her pretty much E_S
107647:44	and I just really feel bad for the guy who *T*-1 his whole life is different *ICH*-2 now E_S and , than he thought 0 it would be *?* . E_S
107715:6	and nobody respects the traditions . E_S
107870:6	and life goes on . E_S
107920:47	\[ My , \+ my \] dress for work , uh , most of the time is , uh , rather comfortable and casual uh , usually , uh , slacks and a soft colored shirt . E_S
107999:11	Well , my husband has *-1 to take the bus into Dallas , and does n't return all day , E_S
108003:16	and even when his job is not going *-1 to be with people all day long *T*-2 , he said 0 it *EXP*-4 's just part of the uniform and the expected image that they have *-3 to dress . E_S
108125:9	Probably my favorite is , um , oh , N_S
108214:8	our whole house is baseball fans E_S
108366:9	\[ the music does , \+
108458:28	\[ the , \+ \] one country and western song sounds like every other , country and western E_S
108470:6	the drummer plays a certain beat , E_S
108642:4	Food is one of my favorite things too . E_S
108736:16	I guess 0 our topic is , um , advice about * going to college . E_S
108835:8	The second thing is 0 some colleges only offer the , uh , liberal arts \[ and , \+ \] uh , whereas like State , they offer engineering courses E_S
108843:19	so depending on what your major is *T*-1 , or medical , you might want *-2 to \[ atteck- , some , \+ um , attend somewhere \] like Tech E_S
108914:44	it was just based *-1 on , you know , how much your tuition costs *T*-2 and everything , E_S
108932:33	and , uh , something that *T*-1 might play a part is the size of the college . E_S
109128:62	I 've got one child , um , that *T*-1 stays with me every day until five , because his mother does n't come home until seven , E_S
109135:8	And the school allows that ? E_S
109185:73	and then when , you know , they go on one salary *T*-3 , will they be able *-2 to sustain what their life-style is *T*-1 . E_S
109488:8	and our home is really too small for us right now . E_S
109519:23	but \[ the , \+ the \] house is real small E_S
109705:6	our house is very old also E_S
109721:4	everything is N_S
109732:10	but the good thing is 0 you can bring out other colors from that E_S
109871:29	* Seems like , um , to me , everything is just changing so much that it 's almost like , um , you ca n't keep up with things any more , E_S
109872:11	and \[ everything is , uh , ther- , \+ \] everyone 's striving so much * to make it equal between men and women , E_S
109953:37	but I should get paid *-1 at least double what my husband makes *T*-3 *-2 working in an office for * staying home E_S
110015:8	and my dog thinks 0 he 's a mother turtle , and always has his nose all around my turtle box , E_S
110048:21	\[ our , \+ our \] love is Golden Retrievers , E_S
110302:21	\[ The , \+ the \] job is what *T*-1 provides all of your needs , E_S

110508:34	Anyway , as far as clothing goes , um , my wardrobe changes all the time , depending on my size . E_S
110551:9	and now nothing seems *-1 to be comfortable because I bulge in all the wrong places , E_S
110566:6	my waist is kind of small compared to the hips , E_S
110892:29	and of course \[ North , \+ North \] Carolina has a terrible reputation as far as education . E_S
110929:11	Well , my son is at Clark this year too , E_S
110944:6	My daughter seems *-1 to be having a good time , E_S
110958:9	Well , Eric seems *-1 to have quite a few nights where he does n't have any *T*-2 , E_S
111040:8	the only problem is that I do quite a bit of traveling , E_S
111163:8	and Texas is , N_S \[ D- , \+ Dallas \] is very nice . E_S
111208:8	and her name is Thumper . E_S
111243:13	What kind of cat is it *T*-1 ? E_S
111362:6	the dog has already been sold *-1 . E_S
111433:39	But I would say service , uh , atmosphere , and whether the food is good , E_S
111462:6	My husband likes , uh , Dairy Queens . E_S
111559:8	but the food is good , E_S
111747:64	unless they 're caught *-1 in the act or \[ \[ the- , \+ the- , \] \+ the \] child is very badly , you know , beaten *-2 up , it comes down to a one word against the other that type thing . E_S
111773:23	I guess kidnapping maybe if the person gets very badly hurt *-1 , you know , E_S
111865:6	my husband has just gotten stuck . E_S
111880:18	and for some reason the cooler weather makes me tend *-1 to want *-2 to go *-3 eat lasagna and garlic bread . E_S
111956:10	but my little girl likes , uh , Spaghetti Warehouse real well . E_S
111970:22	\[ That 's , \+ a steak is \] something that I cook *T*-1 at home . You know , \[ tha- , \+ that \] you grill *T*-2 out E_S
112167:8	and my son plays football . E_S
112169:6	my rule is that they ca n't play a sport the same time of the year , because there 's just not enough of me * to drive them around everywhere . E_S
112200:34	\[ And , \+ uh and \] the , yeah , younger one is , uh , uh , the sports one E_S

112281:8	and my daughter enjoys *-1 writing too , E_S
112419:8	but an aunt keeps the baby . E_S
112493:11	Uh , most everyone has a college degree in like early childhood education . E_S
112695:23	\[ I , \+ my \] dream vacation is Alaska . E_S
112759:272	Uh , \[ my , \+ my \] idea I guess of the ideal vacation would be 0 * to begin with , uh , money be no object .

113142:56	\[ yo- , \+ I guess 0 you \] have *-1 to pay like twenty dollars each month is the N_S
113347:10	And the other thing is , uh , besides that 0 I think , uh , 0 two things that * very definitely need * looking at *T*-1 , one is foreign aid . E_S
113382:8	The biggest part is 0 they have no accountability for what they 're doing *T*-1 . E_S
113386:90	I mean this nonsense that *T*-1 's coming through now about , uh , uh , * lowering payments on Social Security and a few other things that Bush has *T*-2 in mind in order \[ t- , \+ to \] * boost the economy because people have \[ n- , \+ \] more money as \[ it 's , \+ \[ gets , \+ \] it 's \] ridiculous . E_S
113428:37	\[ the biggest , \+ you know , the biggest \] outlaid expense has always been either wars or defense . E_S

113538:26	It 's just the way 0 the law is *T*-1 down here . E_S
113563:8	the death penalty is not given *-1 often . E_S
113641:19	I do n't believe 0 criminal is in a court by itself . E_S

113921:8	The only thing is 0 I 've got *-1 to share with you , 0 my background is from New Jersey . E_S
113921:51	The only thing is 0 I 've got *-1 to share with you , 0 my background is from New Jersey . E_S
113930:9	Because Texan philosophy is a little different . E_S
113935:43	Well , a lot of the experience that I have *T*-1 with this problem has * to do with my brother-in-law who *T*-2 's Chinese and immigrated from China . E_S
114158:63	I do n't want *-1 to do too much on mine because it will be worth more than the car is *?* E_S

114338:44	\[ and , \+ and \] inevitably as soon as they 're asleep , someone calls on the phone *-1 trying *-2 to sell me something . E_S

116463:28	Well , maybe that 's the answer to crime is * getting more prosecution . E_S
116500:44	and probably one of the best things 0 we could do *T*-1 for crime is *-2 to participate ourselves in its prevention . E_S
116515:28	well , you know , the call for help is what *T*-1 scares me now because \[ it , \+ it just , \] N_S

117587:31	and I left him in the kitchen with the little baby gates up while I was gone for about an hour . E_S
117730:9	But the cat does n't destruct does it ? E_S

119074:4	Seattle is only about two and a half hours , E_S
119079:25	and , um , * going over that pass is just a real nightmare . E_S
119092:12	Whistler and Black Home is in Canada , E_S
119122:10	But my youngest son is a skier . E_S
119234:8	and the lake is beautiful , E_S
119351:10	The peace and calmness is really relaxing . E_S
119491:6	my husband is really good at * fixing things , too , E_S
119507:18	but I think 0 the technology is better . E_S
119509:29	\[ Ye- , \+ I \] think 0 technology is better , E_S
119520:4	everything is so automated , uh , E_S
119567:213	but \[ I , \+ again , I \] do n't want *-1 to see us pour \[ a whole lot of economic aid into the Soviet Union without a , \+ uh , well , uh , a whole lot under any circumstances \] because \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know , E_S \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] a believer in the old adage that if somebody earns something it 's worth more *ICH*-2 to them than if you give it to them , E_S
119676:43	but , uh , unfortunately for him , but maybe fortunately for us , his health is not great , E_S
119864:6	the media does , E_S
119877:47	but I think 0 the quality of \[ our , \+ uh , our \] news is just , uh ,
119922:7	Uh nothing is perfect . E_S
119938:8	C N N has the time , since that 's all 0 they do *T*-1 is news *-2 to dig deeper . E_S
119988:9	Well , somebody has *-1 to do it , E_S
120004:11	Now my latest one is classic cars . E_S
120206:4	Tibby is the dog E_S
120207:6	and Liberty is the cat . E_S
120436:48	I guess 0 \[ \[ our , \+ our , \] \+ my \] biggest memory is when we froze to death *T*-1 . E_S
120446:49	we went fairly early in the season for this area , which *T*-1 is probably April is when we went *T*-2 , E_S
120521:8	and the hiking is just really great . E_S
120650:19	and so then last week my mom comes in town , E_S
120690:41	so the most careful thing 0 we do *T*-1 on our yard every August is * put down that Diazinon . E_S
120726:16	They said that every yard has some E_S
120804:4	Pittosporum is kind of borderline here E_S
120817:30	Oh , \[ wax leaf , \+ wax leaf \] ligustrum is the same way . E_S
120845:20	So , it 's like our backyard is just kind of like , N_S
120981:8	Our sales tax is like eight percent , E_S
120982:26	and I do n't know what our gas tax is *T*-1 . E_S
120990:44	It 's just , I mean , 0 you can see that your money is just not going that far . E_S
121078:11	Gardening in Texas is really interesting , though . E_S
121083:13	and , um , Texas is just so hot *ICH*-1 in the summer and so dry , E_S
121104:72	When I go back home to my parents in Illinois in the winter *T*-1 , you know , \[ and \+ \] their grass is fairly green . E_S
121110:33	I think 0 the Saint Augustine and , uh , Centipede grass is another one 0 you have quite a bit of *T*-1 down there E_S
121153:4	Houston is \[ a lot , \+ um , a lot \] wetter \[ than , \+ than \] \[ Dallas , \+ Dallas \] area , E_S
121154:15	that 's where Plano is *T*-1 , E_S
121188:6	my daughter says NINE OH TWO ONE OH . E_S
121215:28	And then Sunday nights we watch , uh , LIFE GOES ON . E_S
121230:17	That one kid that Becca likes *T*-1 he has AIDS . E_S
121242:6	What time is it *T*-1 there ? E_S
121264:6	And MATLOCK is another good one 0 I watch *T*-1 . E_S
121408:5	LIFE GOES ON comes on about the time that we eat dinner *T*-1 , E_S
121666:19	do you know what a fajita is *T*-1 ? E_S
121724:6	capital punishment is necessary \[ in , \+ in \] many cases E_S
122007:6	this lady does that to me at work when I 'm taking an order or something *T*-1 , E_S
122196:11	uh , my dad lives in the state capital , which *T*-1 is Pierre E_S
122393:6	A lot has *-1 to do with how the kids were raised *-2 *T*-3 at home . E_S
122574:35	and \[ i- , \+ inevitably \] one facet of my game is n't working at one time or another . E_S
122903:23	\[ The , \+ the \] first one is 0 we need people *ICH*-2 in there \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 understand , uh , numbers . The numbers that *T*-3 are being thrown *-4 around \[ when , \+ when \] we 're talking in trillions of dollars . Uh , which *T*-5 is an astronomical sum *T*-6 E_S
122907:64	\[ and , \+ and \] the people that *T*-1 are talking this numbers have no concept of what that number means *T*-2 . E_S
123018:13	Part of the problem is 0 we do n't loan from ourselves . E_S
123043:18	and you say 0 our budget is X number of percent of this gross national income . E_S
123060:4	Nothing escapes , right ? E_S
123095:8	My favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers . E_S
123208:70	It 's pretty much going between Washington . They are undefeated . And , uh , Buffalo , New Orleans , and Chicago because Chicago has only lost twice E_S
123243:36	\[ \[ the , \+ their , \] \+ their \] backfield is really impressive . E_S
123279:12	Well , also Houston is , uh , in Pittsburgh 's division E_S
123353:19	Because I know 0 Saint Louis is much bigger than Memphis E_S
123359:41	It 's like the \[ Liberty Bowl \+ or Liberty Stadium \] in Memphis holds about sixty-two , N_S
123428:46	and \[ the average , \+ you know , the average , \] uh , first frost is like the fifteenth of November here E_S
123554:4	nothing bothers them . E_S
123705:17	That 's what my mom does *T*-1 , labor and delivery . E_S
123772:14	I think 0 Dallas is pretty scattered . E_S
123823:6	My name is , uh , Donna Donahue , E_S
123827:6	My name is Lowell , E_S
123837:19	I would say that our home is a very typical home for the area that we live in *T*-1 . E_S
123840:17	and , well , my little girl goes to tap dance , E_S
123841:10	and my little one goes to preschool E_S
123879:16	I know 0 my husband takes an awful lot of time on the weekends , not so much now , but * to , um , maintain the lawn and the edging and the flower beds , E_S
123949:34	\[ and , \+ and , \] um , uh , the landscape is much different *ICH*-1 here in Texas than it is *?* , you know , in the north . Um , or even where you are *T*-2 . E_S
123956:18	but fortunately the home owner 's association does all that . E_S
124000:26	Uh , well , I guess 0 social change takes in \[ a , \+ a \] big category , E_S
124001:76	but , uh , I guess 0 \[ the , \+ the \] one aspect of it that I took *T*-1 in , uh , consideration is more economical . E_S
124005:61	\[ I , \+ I \] know that \[ the amount of , \+ or how far your \] dollar goes *T*-1 probably more than anything \[ has , \+ has \] greatly changed . E_S
124367:6	A game is a game , you know . E_S
124404:8	and the halogen is , uh , an ozone depleter , E_S
124436:22	\[ and , \+ and \] the computer reads whatever the ionization *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 coming out , E_S
124487:62	after you get to like five hundred degrees , * the higher 0 it gets *T*-1 the more complete the combustion is *T*-2 . E_S
124540:38	I was going *-1 to say , 0 my , uh , college is Northern State University in Aberdeen , South Dakota , E_S
124575:16	How long of a program is that *T*-1 ? E_S
124614:45	if you 're going *-1 to go to a college where student faculty ratio is three and four hundred to one *T*-3 , I do n't think 0 you 're going *-2 to have as meaningful of a college experience as if you 're down to the thirty to forty to one . E_S
124704:16	I think 0 your advice is good . E_S
124848:25	\[ Our , \+ our \] only credit card is Sears , E_S
124949:4	Texas is the big one . E_S
125194:6	So everybody has a truck E_S
125217:21	Um I guess 0 my initial view is 0 our tax burden *ICH*-1 has n't gone down in recent years \[ despite , our total tax burden , \+ despite tax cuts \] E_S
125241:80	Well , \[ \[ one , \+ one , \] \+ one \] of the big tax that *T*-1 has gone up a lot in this year is the social security tax which *T*-2 in principle is going \[ into , \+ into \] a big trust fund , E_S
125356:6	my name is Donna , E_S
125406:8	and our church has a Mother 's Day Out program which they started *T*-1 last year , E_S
125435:45	Um , you know , \[ what , \+ what \] kind of a structure is it going *-1 to be *T*-2 . E_S
125444:26	What they do *T*-1 at Shannon 's school is * have a video tape going , E_S
125447:8	and the teacher stays with the sleeping ones , E_S
125466:93	And sometimes when the child 's a lot younger *T*-1 , \[ before they 're really , \+ um , before three years old , \] you know , like the church is a good program E_S
125471:8	and another consideration is \[ how many infants or children are they , \+ \] what 's the ratio \[ of , \+ of \] teachers \[ to \+ to children *T*-1 E_S
125543:6	my name is Donna , E_S
125570:11	Well , my husband swims every day at lunch , which he loves *-1 doing *T*-2 E_S
125577:58	Once in a while or if he has a business meeting or if \[ he , \+ um , someone invites him \] to lunch , \[ he 'll , \+ he 'll \] not go , E_S
125600:36	\[ \[ The , \+ the , \] \+ the \] bicycling is nice especially with the weather around here , E_S

125732:44	\[ and then , \+ and \] * changing gears at stop lights and stuff is really getting on my nerves now . E_S
126023:8	Your shitty golf is probably the best golf 0 I 've ever seen *T*-1 . E_S
126067:11	Um , my sense is that something may just have been done *-1 about it by congressmen MUMBLEx E_S
126172:28	I 'll be thinking in mind 0 the address is , N_S
126198:39	\[ \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] \+ the telephone is \] not the only invasion of privacy . E_S
126344:34	I have a girlfriend that every time 0 her son starts *-1 taking things for granted *T*-2 *T*-3 she threatens *-4 to send him to Mexico with her relatives and let him get a taste of that for a while . E_S
126421:11	Well , my husband works at T I over on Central . E_S
126492:6	My husband is from New Jersey E_S
126498:31	Of course , I think 0 everybody in New Jersey sounds a little bit funny E_S
126540:6	My sister is , E_S
126597:8	and his daughter is an attorney E_S
126743:55	I think 0 we 're going *-1 to have a white Christmas up here just like the song says . E_S
126844:31	\[ it , \+ it \] seems like T I is pretty cut and dried with \[ two , \+ like , two \] or three levels . E_S
127025:39	\[ But , \+ but , \] \[ the , \+ the \] Ukraine is especially significant because \[ it , \+ \] of the agriculture ? E_S
127040:6	And Bush has already given his opinion on it , right ? E_S
127132:46	well , they say , too , that * having a democratic congress and republican President is not good . E_S
127194:74	and \[ I 've , \+ I think 0 the most exercise 0 I 've \] gotten *T*-1 in the last three to four month is *-4 jumping up and down *-2 to go *-3 answer the kids ' questions . E_S
127201:4	exercise is so important . E_S
127250:8	My little Schnauzer wishes 0 I would get out and walk with her . E_S
127278:18	and no matter what the weather is *T*-1 they can walk at a pretty good clip \[ and , \+ and \] not have *-2 to worry about the weather summer or winter . E_S
127313:8	and the water takes the resistance . E_S
127418:20	Well , of course , PEOPLE magazine is not , you know , one of \[ your , \+ uh , your \] more intellectual magazines , E_S
127707:25	\[ What , \+ now what \] night is that on *T*-1 now ? E_S
127867:23	Oh , and they said 0 this lawyer is unbelievable . E_S
127885:13	Well , the NATIONAL ENQUIRER says . N_S
128225:44	I think 0 people need *-1 to understand more like what a meter is *T*-3 , instead of how many feet *T*-2 in a meter or something . Just get used to *-4 using all the terms . E_S
128226:7	Because someone says a kilogram , E_S
128227:6	no one knows what that is *T*-1 . E_S
128237:6	no one seems *-1 to be adopting it . E_S
128238:40	Metric system , \[ no one 's very , \+ uh , no one wants \] it at all * seems like *T*-1 . E_S
128240:41	Uh , \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] public is just very conservative that way in *-1 refusing *-2 to change measurement systems , uh , money , dollar , coins , anything like that . E_S
128261:35	\[ Your , \+ your \] average guy jogging down the highway wants *-1 to know how many miles *ICH*-3 it is *T*-2 to his destination . E_S
128330:36	Uh , I suppose 0 I would ask what the child wants *-1 to do *T*-2 in life and what the child hopes * \[ to , \+ to \] get *T*-3 out of college and what sort of college *T*-4 would best \[ meet , \+ meet \] those needs . E_S
128330:70	Uh , I suppose 0 I would ask what the child wants *-1 to do *T*-2 in life and what the child hopes * \[ to , \+ to \] get *T*-3 out of college and what sort of college *T*-4 would best \[ meet , \+ meet \] those needs . E_S
128342:41	Uh , again \[ what , \+ uh , how \] serious a person is *T*-10 according to , uh , uh , you know , \[ what , \+ what \] they want *-1 to get *T*-2 out of school ,
128343:63	\[ and , \+ \] uh , I guess 0 they 'd have *-1 to consider how expensive the college is *T*-8 and how close to home , if they could handle *-3 being away for real long periods of time or if they need *-4 to be somewhere where they can drive home when they needed *-5 to get home *T*-6 *T*-7 . E_S
128355:25	I guess 0 one clear-cut piece of advice is by all means * visit the college campus . E_S
128430:6	my son is certainly not persuaded *-1 of that . E_S
128530:23	and it will be 0 a next generation meets this generation . E_S
128676:15	but , uh , Jean Luke does more of \[ a , \+ a , \] committee type of management . E_S
128703:12	in fact , Thing has a \[ big , \+ much bigger \] role than he does in the series . E_S
128704:46	I mean , you know , there is lots of areas where Thing saves the day *T*-1 . E_S
128771:19	Durham , Raleigh , and Chapel Hill is the triangle . E_S
128788:6	Chapel Hill is kind of \[ a , \+ a \] ritzy city or whatever . E_S
128792:4	Durham has probably got the worst . E_S
128817:26	\[ and the , \+ and the \] economy is so bad E_S
128820:6	The economy is lousy . E_S
128842:26	Well , now , do you find that security is very good \[ \[ in , \+ in a , \] \+ in a \] town home ? E_S
128885:11	and now the economy is bad , E_S
128900:32	But , unemployment *ICH*-1 now in Dallas , or in Texas is up around six point , N_S
128937:15	And , uh , the snow is like , really cold . E_S
128962:16	but I think 0 Iowa is a lot colder . E_S
128978:8	So the humidity is I think 0 *T*-2 what *T*-1 does it . E_S
129184:7	Here name is Lori , Bird . E_S
129288:42	I mean , if he 's going *-1 to be drastic , somebody has *-2 to be drastic back . E_S
129396:6	this guy is up for the death penalty . E_S
129411:10	but the only result is , 0 otherwise he gets life in prison . E_S
129639:11	Um , my father owns a restaurant . E_S
129689:42	\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 * decorating your food is , you know , really , N_S

130215:6	My car is really old , too , E_S
130240:9	and then insurance is really high for that , too E_S
130266:14	I mean that insurance is high dollars . E_S
130426:4	Everybody has tinted down here . E_S
130459:28	It 's like , you know , N_S everybody freaks out when it sn- , N_S
130471:6	Her grandmother lives there E_S
130751:4	everyone does newspapers . E_S
130755:4	everybody does newspapers . E_S
131267:55	but , uh one of the big changes , uh , 0 they 're doing *T*-1 in Salt Lake is , uh , N_S
131661:57	and , of course , Judeo-Christianity , uh , and of the Jewish folks , too , believe that the family unit is the one that *T*-1 was given *-2 the , uh , uh , mission by the Lord * to do this very thing . E_S
131715:55	\[ And my mother who *T*-1 is now , \+ \[ he 's , \+ my stepfather is \] dead , but my mother who *T*-2 is now seventy-one , \] I can remember her being , I believe *RNR*-4 a sixteen *RNR*-3 or a fourteen *RNR*-3 handicap , E_S
131801:6	my control is a little bit better there . E_S
131853:49	if you 'll take lessons , the first thing 0 they put *T*-1 in your hand is an iron . E_S
131859:32	\[ so , \+ but \] I think 0 the key is 0 \[ you just need *-1 to , \+ you need *-2 to \] play more often than I play . E_S
131872:8	the one iron is something 0 I 've been thinking because my driver 's gone so badly lately that \[ I , \+ I \] should pick *T*-2 one up and try *-1 to start . E_S
131889:32	\[ My cha- , \+ my challenge \] of the game is just ,

132013:8	And my notebook is somewhere around here . E_S
132043:29	Uh , do you know where , uh , Custer is *T*-1 ? E_S
132132:11	And boy that thing screams now . E_S
132141:79	Well , I thought 0 was funny that they kept *-1 pushing the three eighty-six S X even though \[ the , \+ the \] price difference is about ten dollars . E_S
132173:55	and I think the costs and \[ the , \+ uh , the \] way 0 the medical profession has , every year N_S
132181:33	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 the medical profession is \[ just , \+ just \] pushing until there 's no option but 0 the government take it over E_S
132185:43	What about , you know , you know how expensive new equipment and technology is *T*-1 . E_S
132203:16	I mean if anyone does , this guy knows it . E_S
132203:26	I mean if anyone does , this guy knows it . E_S
132233:35	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't care what anyone says *T*-1 . E_S

132272:25	Uh , you know , if the doctor is wrong , you know , he should be pulled *-1 from his license , E_S
132274:19	and away he goes because insurance pays for it , you know , E_S
132365:11	Well , the problem is that I am so tired at the end of the day , E_S
132378:4	School is not over until , uh , four E_S
132524:8	The hard thing is * getting *-1 going . E_S
132620:24	And the idea of that kind of taxation is * to have people think twice on * putting their money into that , I guess 0 *T*-1 , you know , unless they really want it ,
132663:40	it seems like \[ a , \+ a \] big thing for Christmas is usually ham . E_S
132886:6	The question is , I mean , would I want *-1 to buy *?* , E_S
132928:6	my car is the first one 0 we ever bought *T*-1 *-2 new , too . E_S
133028:64	one thing 0 \[ I , \+ I \] really liked *T*-1 \[ about , \+ about \] the Dodge Daytona is the fact that they have , uh , this seven year warranty . E_S
133051:17	usually , you know something breaks , E_S
133123:15	and , um , my husband has really wanted one for a long time , E_S
133143:6	my sister drives one . E_S
133206:22	Well , that 's what my husband thinks *T*-1 about my car now , that he 's had the Legend E_S
133264:22	\[ and , \+ and \] my dad is actually on the school board there , E_S
133275:6	And Arlington is excellent now , E_S
133283:4	Something is definitely wrong . E_S
133295:6	Another problem is 0 you 're going *-1 to keep the smarter people in the system too long *-2 paying the wages 0 they do *T*-3 . E_S
133326:49	It depends on , uh , what school you 're in *T*-1 and who your teacher is *T*-2 , actually E_S
133331:9	Overall , Arlington is good , one of the better ones in the state , E_S
133336:13	that 's the thing is * just to look at the school system in the area that you move into *T*-1 before you . N_S
133360:52	But , uh . We actually rank *-1 forty-ninth in the world as far as just plain literacy goes *?* , you know . E_S
133410:9	Well , AIDS is a nasty , terrible disease , E_S
133449:6	Whose figure is that *T*-1 ? E_S
133536:20	Is it just that the immune system ceases *-1 to function properly E_S
133541:14	and the white blood cell count goes down , E_S
133565:20	Uh , the short term , the recession is \[ getting , \+ getting \] top attention . E_S
133569:13	0 The other thing is *T*-1 , is that we 've got \[ \[ these , \+ um , these , \] \+ all these \] bank defaults going on , \[ and , \+ and \] savings and loan defaults , \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , uh , N_S
133598:6	my understanding is 0 \[ what they 're try- , \+ \[ what , \+ what \] supposedly they 're trying \] *-1 to do *T*-3 by *-4 reducing taxes is * to kind of jump start the economy , the idea being that if people have *-2 to pay less money in taxes , they 'll have more money 0 * to spend *T*-5 , uh , E_S
133607:31	It 's probably a judgment of how bad the recession is *T*-1 . E_S
133637:85	Um , at various places 0 * to look *T*-1 \[ for , \+ for \] * cutting the budget , first of all I consider more defense cuts than *?* are already planned *-2 depending on the world situation . E_S
133653:4	Education happens *-1 to be one place where I think that we would foolish *-2 to um , uh *T*-3 , N_S
133809:6	What color is it *T*-1 ? E_S
133875:17	I got a Mickey Mouse print is what I got *T*-1 . E_S
133881:36	Normally it will tell you on the roll how often a pattern repeats *T*-1 . E_S
134015:43	but \[ I , \+ I \] find interesting tidbits in what the news reports *T*-1 as far as \[ the , \+ like the \] state of North Carolina 's budget , and stuff like that . E_S
134016:22	And I really know what the budget is *T*-1 , E_S
134018:52	and , you know , I 'm well aware of the billions of assets that the state has *T*-1 , E_S
134028:100	I think 0 they need *-1 to \[ do a little bit , \+ go into a little bit \] more depth , uh , before they would just report , like 0 somebody wants *-2 to make a statement or something like that , E_S
134029:19	because I mean , another example is the , uh , AIDS issue or whatever . E_S
134032:33	the headlines on the news or whatever is , 0 Someone says 0 they found a cure for AIDS . E_S
134197:16	Well , a brand new Volvo costs , what , thirty thousand dollars ? E_S
134211:63	\[ and so , \+ um , anyway , and \] \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] the other thing is that \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] never really been too terribly much of a new car person . E_S
134227:58	and I 've made many trips to Washington and down to Virginia Beach , Virginia , where my mother lives *T*-1 , and things like that , E_S
134262:19	But , uh , if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad . E_S
134289:4	Wisconsin has \[ a , \+ a \] law in which we need *-1 to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag *T*-2 and they are tested *-3 for , uh , their pollution control equipment *T*-4 , E_S
134307:4	Madison has one of the nicest , uh , bike , uh , road , uh , sharing programs \[ of , \+ of \] any city in Wisconsin E_S
134311:8	and all Wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of , uh , bike trails for recreational use of any of the states . E_S
134361:114	\[ Do you find that , \+ um , \[ or , \+ or \] do you hypothesize \[ that , \+ that \] \] most of the , uh , smog \[ or , \+ or \] air pollution comes from vehicles E_S
134391:6	my husband does the majority of \[ the , \+ um , the , \] uh , gardening , uh , * taking care of the lawn and fertilizing , E_S
134401:6	My wife works \[ \[ \[ in , you know , at , \] \+ at , \] \+ at \] the T I , E_S
134485:15	but , um , my husband takes it on , E_S
134537:162	and \[ I , \+ uh , I \] think 0 \[ what we 're , \+ what we 're \] trying *-1 to do *T*-2 is * create sort of a wind break because I tell you , in the winter time \[ when that , \+ when that \] wind comes out of the north *T*-3 , it just cuts right through you like you 're not even there . E_S
134623:21	I guess , uh , 0 space is , uh , real important , I think , E_S
134814:49	At least \[ that was , \+ you know , that 's \] what everybody says *T*-1 . E_S
134844:4	One hopes . E_S
134879:118	Uh , and it 's , uh , I guess 0 *T*-2 what they call *T*-1 a story and a half . E_S Because it 's not a full two story . Where , you know , everything on top is on bottom *T*-1 . E_S
134884:10	and the other half is just standard sized ceilings . E_S
134899:4	Landmark is the one who *T*-1 built it . E_S
134950:48	And , uh , see \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] state has a law that *T*-1 says 0 you can not borrow the money *-2 to build your own home . E_S
134987:25	But , uh , you know , my home is , uh , fairly simple . E_S
135015:13	And my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon . E_S
135041:63	Well , I took a lot of time in *-1 choosing this site because \[ the , \+ the \] house has no heating or air conditioning . E_S
135073:17	And , uh , the east side is glass . E_S
135104:92	\[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the , \] N_S what I call *T*-1 *RNR*-2 residential level at the side that *T*-3 's in the hill is about four feet deep . E_S

135209:9	actually the sewing is n't the hard part , E_S
135277:59	and , \[ what , I 'm , \+ what I \] think now 0 *T*-1 is the reason is 0 I kept the tank too clean E_S
135479:13	because if the baby is strong enough , it can swim away fast enough and go *-1 hide . E_S
135586:8	Margaret Truman Daniels writes a lot those . E_S
135704:24	and it seems to me like Susan Howatch does not write as often . E_S
135808:35	The weather \[ is , \+ uh , this time of year has actually been \] kind of unusual . E_S
135912:8	and the rain is n't falling , E_S
135985:53	Well , do you think 0 \[ this , \+ \[ the , \+ the \] \] weather is typical for this time of the year ? E_S
136243:6	what time is that on *T*-1 , E_S
136345:18	but you know , the thing is that this happens , E_S
136505:35	And * remember *-1 to yell Geronimo , if all else fails . E_S
136522:44	this part of the country , N_S actually , they say that when the house is , uh , fifteen *T*-1 , it 's already old , E_S
136527:4	Thing is , N_S 0 \[ we 've , \+ uh , the main thing that we 've \] had *T*-1 with this house recently has been some , uh , squirming , I call it * , of the foundation . E_S
136538:31	and , uh of course the soil right under the slab retains its moisture a lot longer E_S
136658:11	Well , my son is my aide . E_S
136723:6	the kitchen needs *-1 to be cleaned *-2 E_S
136977:31	Um , I think , uh , 0 the biggest limitation is a lot , just time and money , is n't it *?* . E_S
137003:6	The downtown is all like little shops and candy shops E_S
137005:28	I do n't think , uh , 0 hardly anybody lives there , E_S
137090:8	and the lake goes on forever , E_S
137149:11	Well , my daughter is twenty-one now , E_S
137685:6	so everybody is really excited . E_S
137693:30	\[ so , \+ you know , so \] everybody has the feeling like we can go all the way to the Super Bowl , E_S

137822:4	Lexus is a Toyota subbrand . E_S
137860:22	\[ and , \+ but \] the particular seems *-1 to be \[ the , \+ uh , the \] quiet ride . E_S
137931:4	snow does n't happen very often . E_S
138039:8	the Lincoln ride is certainly good , too ,
138040:23	but \[ the , \+ this \] Lexus is nothing like 0 I have ever been in *T*-1 before . E_S
138061:16	I know 0 my son goes to a private school , E_S
138090:14	How big of a school is it *T*-1 ? E_S
138198:11	Well , the world changes , E_S
138205:6	so life is not maybe as simple as it was *?* at one time , E_S
138257:41	\[ Do , \+ uh , does \] this school 0 your son goes to *T*-1 , do they , uh , \[ re- , \+ require \] * to wear a uniform E_S

138379:8	Radial arm saw is , I guess 0 *T*-3 , what they 're called *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
138437:35	and I think 0 \[ the , \+ the \] main thing is , like you say , 0 \[ it 's a , \+ it 's a \] good out . E_S
138490:35	Uh , I think 0 the ratio of kids to teacher is really important . E_S
138659:52	Uh , Well , I think 0 universal health insurance , like national health , like what Canada has *T*-1 ,
138660:48	Is that what \[ you 're , \+ you 're \] thinking 0 the subject is about *T*-2 ? E_S
138669:27	I think 0 that 's what the subject is about *T*-1 . E_S
138679:33	Uh , the state of Washington and the state of Minnesota is , uh , going *-1 to begin *-2 testing \[ a program , \+ a state funded program \] for citizens of those two states E_S
138681:121	I think 0 it 's a trend \[ \[ that *T*-3 's , \+ that *T*-4 's , \] \+ that *T*-1 's , \] uh , probably may go nationwide eventually because I think 0 national health is something that we all need *T*-2 . E_S
138690:88	So we live in a society *ICH*-2 , though , where everyone if you ask them on polls , will , uh , say that they think that everyone has a right to health care *T*-1 . E_S
138732:13	But , yet , Parkland is not free , either . E_S
138808:23	in case you did n't know , Texas leads the nation in uninsured children . E_S
138899:10	as each employee comes in part of the hiring procedure is \[ a , \+ a \] blood test .
138899:30	as each employee comes in part of the hiring procedure is \[ a , \+ a \] blood test .
139309:53	the only thing 0 you have *-1 to watch out *T*-2 in this part of the country is during the change type seasons is the really severe storms that *T*-3 occasionally come through out here on the plains . E_S
139350:10	of course hindsight is all too clear . E_S
139400:21	and I do n't think 0 everybody knows the whole situation . E_S
139431:4	Seventy-four is when they quit * sending troops *T*-1 . E_S
139736:10	until the rice looks fluffy , \[ and \+ and \] not overdone . You know , before it gets overdone . E_S
139750:44	Um , I 'd let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster . E_S
139781:23	\[ And , \+ because \] my daughter calls it her gravy E_S
139835:8	and campus housing does not even allow * thinking about that . E_S
139929:23	Right at the base of that northern peninsula is *T*-1 my hometown . E_S
139943:21	well , um , my parents ' house is like three miles south of where the Mason-Dixon Line would have hit the Ohio River *T*-1 had it continued that far . E_S
140218:24	I tell everyone this story because my wife is a real pet lover . E_S
140235:12	in fact my brother has \[ a , \+ uh , a \] exotic pet shop out in California , E_S
140591:63	Actually we had an \[ apartment , \+ two bedroom apartment \] that *T*-1 was about as big as this house is *?* . E_S
140660:8	But our neighborhood has \[ a , \+ just a \] wide variety \[ of , \+ of , \] um , people , E_S
140980:25	and they did pretty good , except this dog is , N_S
141018:26	Um , \[ our , \+ our \] friend has a , N_S
141040:8	except the baby plays in the playground . E_S
141068:28	I 'm , basically the story person because my husband does n't have , N_S
141282:13	Most of the family is right in the West Virginia , uh , uh , what they call *T*-1 Tri-State area , uh , northern West Virginia , eastern Ohio , southwestern Pennsylvania . E_S
141286:6	Most everybody is right in that area . E_S
141330:13	and , uh , everybody brings lots of food E_S
141375:57	\[ They usually , \+ uh , they \] have been happening , uh , just after the summer semester starts . E_S
141392:26	Well , \[ my , \+ my \] grandfather is the only one that *T*-1 is still around . E_S
141396:13	And see , my grandmother is the one that *T*-1 use *-2 to plan this stuff basically . E_S
141449:4	everybody brings their favorite dish E_S
141450:8	and , somebody brings the volleyball net , E_S
141451:4	somebody brings a whole lot of ice for the watermelon E_S
141559:15	uh , E_S and our girl is thirteen . E_S
141607:8	Our little boy is in the first grade E_S
141615:11	Well , my wife is involved E_S
141638:4	history is what their peace class is *T*-1 this year . E_S
141638:19	history is what their peace class is *T*-1 this year . E_S
141685:14	Of course , the baby is young , E_S
141747:20	but , uh , uh , the winter gets long . E_S
141796:6	the library has a paper . E_S
142122:25	And , I do n't think 0 a cart damages the turf . E_S
142167:45	so I would have *-1 to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and Boy Scouts is my hobby . E_S
142382:30	But , uh , you know , now all my life is more like * camping than * not camping really . E_S
142482:6	my mom goes *-1 camping you know . E_S
142624:6	the brick is multi color . Mostly earth tones . E_S
142976:38	Well , I 'm just gullible enough that I think 0 Bobby Valentine is , um , uh , doing all right E_S
143208:63	but I just love *-1 going over to Europe because \[ it 's so , \+ their way of life is just so \] different than ours . E_S
143382:23	and , uh , you know , everybody says , you know , how many houses *T*-1 are on the market and all that kind of thing E_S
143630:21	At any rate , uh , the topic is fascinating because one of the things 0 I 've done *T*-1 for the past few years is , uh , research the problem from the point of view of , uh , uh , what *T*-2 appears *-4 to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically *T*-3 . E_S
143639:13	Well , the cooperative learning is a technique that *T*-1 was tried *-2 initially * to integrate the public schools . E_S
143641:15	and the , uh , teacher becomes \[ a , \+ uh , a \] sort of a \[ consultant , \+ resource person \] \[ to the cooperative learning , \+ uh , to the learning cooperatives , \] I guess 0 they 're called *-1 *RNR*-2 . E_S
143657:9	So my feeling is that , uh , \[ the , \+ the \] problem \[ is , \+ is , \] uh , significant . E_S There are plenty of good people , uh , available * to , uh , offer people educational experience , E_S but that we just have *-1 to \[ re- , \+ reallocate \] and reorganize the resources * to do it E_S
143662:10	And , my feeling is that , uh , those kinds of things will solve the problem eventually . E_S
143664:30	Uh , uh , but , I think that the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we 're paying an enormous price for , uh , inferior quality when the people involved really are n't inferior *T*-1 , E_S
143673:28	but clearly what *T*-1 's happened in this country is 0 the school system 's been asked *-2 to assume a great many responsibilities *ICH*-3 in the past thirty years that *T*-4 were n't existent , uh , E_S
143862:27	I 'm not even sure what their interest rate is *T*-1 since I pay it off E_S
143896:20	And I think 0 the service charge is pretty low , too , E_S
143989:24	my own feelings about , uh , capital punishment is 0 I think 0 it should be mandatory upon a third conviction felony . E_S
144004:42	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] also firmly believe that no one is beyond reclamation . E_S
144073:48	As far as capital punishment , I think that , uh , ten years on death row is cruel and unusual punishment . E_S
144139:31	You know , and they convicted this guy because somebody says , well , he looks like the right guy . E_S
144216:6	Billy Owens looks like he was , N_S
144275:11	Uh , San Antonio pulls for San Antonio , E_S
144276:6	and Houston pulls \[ for , \+ for \] the Rockets . E_S
144291:25	because \[ s- , \+ San \] Antonio is n't that close to you , are they *?* ? E_S
144474:50	and \[ I , \+ I \] feel like *-1 just saying , uh , safe sex is not the answer . E_S
144646:29	And I know 0 a lot of our tax money goes to that . E_S
144775:37	I think , uh , you know , 0 as any city grows up , uh , you get the hoods and the \[ roof- , \+ riffraff \] and everybody else in there , E_S
144943:66	And , uh , I think that that is , you know , very significant that the percentage of the work force today consists of such a high percent of women . E_S
144978:74	every once in a while you read in the newspaper *RNR*-3 or you 'll see it on T V or something *RNR*-3 where the discussion comes out that , you know , women are paid *-1 less than men *T*-2 E_S
145166:123	actually spring semester a year from now he 's going *-1 to have *-2 to be in child care \[ f- , \+ uh , five \] days a week more than likely . Uh , depending on how my class schedule runs *T*-3 E_S
145178:23	So , depending on what my class schedule looks like *T*-1 , he may spend \[ four , \+ \[ si- , \+ \] anywhere from four *RNR*-2 \+ \] to eight *RNR*-2 hours a day in child care at that point . E_S
145182:8	and my wife is already supposed *-1 to be on her way to her class .
145233:8	And our daughter is healthy , happy , well adjusted and enjoys *-1 going *-2 to see her friends , E_S
145312:113	I think that , uh , my own interest \[ in , \+ in \] \[ development , \+ human development \] leads me to believe that that 's a good sign and that , uh , private enterprise is the way 0 * to go *T*-1 and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way 0 we learn *T*-2 . E_S
145632:50	And , uh , \[ \[ the , \+ his , \] \+ his \] dad 's family is all around the area E_S
145644:52	and that person can call , you know , beforehand and just make * sure 0 everyone knows , too . E_S
145702:16	and , uh , inevitably everyone is just very interested E_S
145710:9	and so everyone has *-1 to update their little books or whatever . E_S
145885:14	uh , because my husband gets , his medical through his company , E_S
146202:38	Well , one thing that I like *T*-1 about this fabric painting thing is 0 I can just make a T shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then , um , cut out a little pattern *ICH*-2 \[ from the material , \+ from some material , \] like flowers or something , and make , um , a design or , you know , a little arrangement or something on the shirt and , you know , fuse it on with Heat and Bond , or whatever and then paint around it . E_S
146345:60	because \[ he , \+ he \] thinks 0 the newer ones is like a soap opera and the other one is n't *?* or something , E_S
146369:20	That 's sort of how Matlock is *T*-1 , E_S
146370:6	but COLOMBO is way tricky E_S
146490:6	my name is Dolphene . E_S
146494:6	my name is Pat Johnson E_S
146524:65	\[ I , \+ I \] believe , if I , am in a position , uh , like when my mother gets to a point where she needs special care *T*-1 *T*-2 that I will be able *-4 to just bring her *ICH*-3 into my home and my father also , \[ and \+ uh , or \] have someone go into their home , you know \[ and \+ uh , and \] look \[ after \+ \] them . E_S
146553:13	but attitude of staff makes such a tremendous difference . E_S
146596:60	I think 0 it would matter too , uh , kinds of , uh , disabilities that the nursing home accepts *T*-1 . Because there are some , uh , who *T*-2 poor things , you know , do n't have , uh , any real grasp on reality any longer . E_S
146645:53	I think 0 if we wait *ICH*-3 , uh , which *T*-1 is happening until somebody says 0 we have *-2 to do it it is going *-4 to be to late . E_S
146696:35	An- , that 's how it is *T*-1 in New York is n't it *?* . E_S
146727:9	Like our garage is always full of sacks of newspapers E_S
146773:4	Texas is not one of them see . E_S
147159:111	I think 0 something *ICH*-2 too that you probably see *T*-3 in older states , all \[ we , \+ we \] do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces *T*-1 . E_S
147180:8	and our economy seems *-1 to , N_S
147193:6	My husband likes *-1 to go out and jog E_S
147269:11	and then my sister takes care of her . E_S
147416:15	And everybody in my family has always had , N_S
147474:14	I mean my mom is kind of old-fashioned , you know . E_S
147565:17	And \[ my \+ \] boss is a black woman and has only been there a couple of months and already promoted *-1 E_S
147728:58	Uh , I think 0 it probably is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody *T*-1 . E_S
147885:8	the Japanese government is always having \[ a , \+ some \] kind of a scandal . E_S
147941:34	Well , one thing that *T*-1 's helped us a lot is that , uh , \[ you , \+ you know , you \] can buy a lot of these operas now on \[ video casse- , \+ uh , video tape \] E_S
147968:23	So , I 'd say , 0 Vivaldi is probably my favorite , uh , composer . E_S
148174:17	Kind of away from the crowd is why we chose that one *T*-1 . E_S
148191:16	I understand 0 Deer Valley is nice , too . E_S
148207:11	so the DECORATIVE WOODWORKING has just been a great , great help . E_S
148219:10	but the whole magazine is just filled *-1 with , uh , pictures and projects that you can make *T*-2 yourself , E_S
148261:24	and by the time 0 the next round comes in *T*-1 I 'm still not through *-2 reading the first round . E_S
148265:11	Oh , SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN comes to our house , too ,
148370:21	Well , as far as the rap goes , I think 0 there are a few artists that *T*-1 appeal to me themselves E_S
148451:6	My dad is a big blue grass fan , E_S
148501:15	that type of country western is what \[ I , \+ I \] like *-1 to listen to *T*-2 . E_S
148609:41	\[ and , \+ and \] the one D J said , who the heck is Bonnie Rait *T*-1
148626:13	but right now my passion is tole painting . E_S
148673:8	and tole painting is just \[ a , \+ \] you know , something 0 I do *T*-1 in my spare time E_S
148763:8	the band saw is really nice . E_S
148876:19	I know where fifty-six hundred south is *T*-1 . E_S
149155:154	You know , when you write a test *T*-1 you have *-2 to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing *T*-3 and find out which ones *T*-4 are discriminating well and which ones *T*-5 are n't *?* find out how reliable the test is *T*-6 , E_S
149726:16	I think 0 the budget is really out of hand right now , E_S
149802:44	But it seems to me \[ that , \+ uh , that \] the budget is so out of hand , E_S
149803:34	and especially now that they say , Okay , the cold war is over E_S
149808:38	Well , I 'd really like *-1 to know where that money is actually going *-2 to go *T*-3 , E_S
149921:57	and that 's what *T*-1 really is getting me about what George Bush 's stand on the budget is *T*-2 right now is that he is saying , I am going *-3 to give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you 'll be happy come November , and you 'll elect me again E_S
149966:69	however I think , 0 the area that I live in *T*-1 \[ it 's not , \+ uh , the crime level is not \] as high as it is *?* in other areas \[ of the , \+ of the \] city . E_S
150134:81	Uh , \[ and , \+ uh , and , \] you know , about half the time \[ they seem *-1 to , \+ the A P D seems *-2 to \] recover them , you know in various states of disrepair . Up on blocks . E_S
150187:58	Uh , * seems to me that everything that I buy *T*-1 goes bad just after the warranty runs out . E_S
150312:11	and so our testing is pretty thorough , E_S
150332:12	so , each assembly process has an inspection right after it 's done *-1 , E_S
150378:12	where the school district does , um , 0 the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of , uh , costs *T*-1 . E_S
150386:18	I think 0 the biggest frustration is 0 because of the cost of insurance going up every year , our district has had *-1 to \[ alter , \+ uh , you know , change \] companies , E_S
150397:8	my medical coverage is with an H M O E_S
150492:19	It is just , 0 Texas has really , um , you know , N_S
150739:8	and the muscle builds real fast . E_S
150781:50	and I do n't watch T V as much really either , because , uh , my free time is kind of , N_S
150979:55	I think that , uh , one , uh , advantage of * having , uh , the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want *-1 to make * sure that you do n't , uh , convict someone who , uh , *T*-3 really should n't be convicted *-2 . E_S
151065:101	Uh , \[ one , \+ one \] thing that \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 *T*-1 \[ is , \+ um , you know , maybe is \] a problem is , uh , \[ I , \+ I \] think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now , E_S
151065:146	Uh , \[ one , \+ one \] thing that \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 *T*-1 \[ is , \+ um , you know , maybe is \] a problem is , uh , \[ I , \+ I \] think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now , E_S
151227:31	but it 's just whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like , you know , N_S
151342:44	and , you know , * being fair to the person , if the government does n't prove its case , no matter how you feel *T*-1 , you have *-2 to go by what *T*-3 's offered *-4 as proof , E_S
151453:20	\[ and \+ and \] the policy is something like , * see if I can \[ re- , \+ state \] this correctly now . If you turn yourself in as *-1 having a drug related problem , then you 're eligible for company counseling . E_S
151467:16	I think 0 our policy is that , N_S
151517:23	and I 'm not sure if our policy covers that or not . E_S
151566:119	Well , \[ \[ I think , \+ I think \] \+ \[ we , \+ I \] think \] 0 the problem here \[ is , \+ is \] that \[ a , \+ a \] drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs . E_S
151607:51	I mean \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a pretty personal thing when somebody says I want *-1 to look at your urine before I 'm going *-2 to talk to you *T*-3 . E_S
151665:11	but when somebody leaves work *T*-1 , I do n't think that it *EXP*-2 's the employer 's right * to regulate their life style at all . E_S
151670:136	Uh , I really think 0 it should be *?* , except as I 've mentioned twice now , in the specified industries \[ or , \+ or \] jobs , because there are certain things where it *EXP*-1 's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times *T*-3 . E_S
151836:36	we sent out five hundred , uh , announcements , because our family is quite large , like \[ your , \+ your \] family there . E_S
151847:29	but \[ most of , \+ all \] my family lives like in the same county E_S
151863:6	our family ranges from , oh , goodness , well , Australia , E_S I have a brother lives in Australia , to , uh , Boise , Idaho , \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , all kinds of places . E_S
151863:51	our family ranges from , oh , goodness , well , Australia , E_S I have a brother lives in Australia , to , uh , Boise , Idaho , \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , all kinds of places . E_S
151907:13	Just like this town is too small for me , E_S
151990:25	but \[ that , \+ that \] particular bothers me . E_S
152010:23	well , you know , its latent heat is high , E_S
152022:15	and so if the car sucks in , uh , fifty degrees , N_S
152188:17	Do you know what armadillo is *T*-1 ? E_S
152354:16	I think 0 health care is probably \[ \[ the , \+ the most pressing \] \+ uh , the pressing \] one , E_S
152387:8	The benefits plan is different \[ for operating , \+ for what we call *T*-1 operating \] staff , which *T*-2 are considered *-3 to be , uh , clerical personnel , accountants , things like that as opposed to what they call *T*-4 the P A T staff , which I belong to *T*-5 E_S
152396:10	But the main difference is in \[ the , \+ uh , the \] way 0 sick time is accrued *-1 and vacation time is accrued *-2 *T*-3 . E_S
152453:45	but * not being in \[ the \+ say the \] commercial sector , the motivation is n't there for a lot of people uh , like really , N_S
152560:9	because my perspective is from an institution , E_S
152561:57	uh , \[ the , \+ there \] is not much incentive for innovativeness because the limitation for reward is very severe E_S
152682:23	\[ the , \+ the \] same crime gets unequal sentences . E_S
152754:68	I have been involved , uh , just \[ sli- , \+ slightly \] in a case where I know 0 the person is guilty *T*-1 E_S
152769:96	Well Jackie , uh , on taxes , \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 I would have *-1 to say , \[ that I , \+ that my \] opinion is that I do think 0 Americans are paying too much in taxes . E_S
152848:16	and that is that money tends *-1 to stick where it lands first *T*-2 E_S
152941:44	\[ What is , \+ do you know what \] your state income tax rate is *T*-1 ? E_S
152949:6	My dad does it all for me . E_S
152996:6	The radio does n't really have much news sometimes . E_S
153003:18	Do you think that T V is , uh , pretty accurate . E_S
153007:65	Well , what I really do n't like *T*-1 about T V , especially local news as compared to like national news is just , uh , 0 \[ it seems , \+ it seems \] like everything is very spoon feed E_S
153007:114	Well , what I really do n't like *T*-1 about T V , especially local news as compared to like national news is just , uh , 0 \[ it seems , \+ it seems \] like everything is very spoon feed E_S
153043:38	\[ and so \+ \] that \[ then \+ \] like local news is really who *T*-1 grew the biggest tomato E_S
153162:42	and I really think that you know in the involvement that the press states *T*-1 , you know \[ that \+ \] \[ the \+ the \] military basically sets the press , E_S
153183:21	\[ This , \+ this \] cat is a , uh , more like a dog . E_S
153202:10	but if anybody reaches over *-1 to pet him or whatever , he 'll just kind of look at them like what are doing *T*-2 . E_S
153243:21	and we got it because my wife stays here at home alone while I go to work E_S
153472:19	I do n't know if Dallas is in the top three E_S
153492:12	I mean somebody is not going *-1 to break in , steal it , and you know , use it *-2 to mug someone , you know . E_S
153514:11	then the actual shot does n't go that far , you know ,
153541:21	\[ that , \+ that \] person rushes you . E_S
153652:16	Then when the tax bill comes in *T*-1 I 've got that much set *-2 aside . E_S
153677:6	My wife has a car E_S
153707:6	My wife uses hers just for pleasure E_S
153790:9	but gun control is probably frowned on *-2 quite a bit down there I would think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
154252:26	\[ and he works , \+ and my husband works \] full times days E_S
154312:32	Well , it helps you to focus where your money goes *T*-1 E_S
154787:73	The one 0 I think 0 *T*-1 is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that , uh , the industry seems *-2 to be doing *T*-3 with the recycled polymers . Uh , everything from , uh , waste baskets to carpet to \[ the no stick , \+ I mean the sticky \] slide rugs under the carpet E_S
154874:14	I think 0 exercise is extremely important E_S
154971:10	When my wife lets me *T*-1 . E_S
155154:8	The only disadvantage is that they do n't pick it up at the curb . E_S
155199:31	Generally \[ the , \+ uh , the \] handicapped group takes care of the things that N_S
155201:28	and then the recycler run * by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit E_S
155216:8	but Central Canada tends *-1 to referred more to Ontario and Quebec E_S
155281:43	but , uh , we 're to the point *ICH*-1 now where our financial income is enough that we can consider *-2 putting some away for college *T*-3 , E_S
155307:9	Well our situation is just \[ a little bit , \+ kind of the opposite \] of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently , uh , took on a full time job ,
155390:148	\[ \[ I 'm , \+ I , \] \+ uh , it 's \] called *-1 living within your means . You know , which *T*-2 means at the moment , * paying off the VISA bill and keeping everything else under control and hoping 0 the car does n't collapse . E_S
155633:39	and it depends on \[ how , \+ how \] sick the person is *T*-1 too .
155752:118	\[ \[ \[ I , \+ I think , \] \+ I think 0 the , \] \+ uh I think that \] the decision that *T*-1 needs *-3 to be made *-4 though on nursing home has *-5 to be a joint one between the , uh , elderly uh , person who *T*-2 's going in and the family that *T*-6 's going *-7 to be , uh , \[ effec- , \+ effected *-8 \] by it E_S
155797:53	So , so \[ you think , \+ uh , I think \] that a short work week is real nice . E_S
155873:8	and my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants *T*-1 E_S
155931:28	Uh , \[ my , \+ my \] personal opinion is that , uh , the politicians are out for their own good because \[ they , \+ they 're \] entrenched . E_S
156011:60	Uh , \[ the other , \+ the other \] thing that , uh , *T*-1 bothers me about our system is just that , uh , \[ \[ \[ \[ \[ in , \+ for , \] \+ for , \] \+ in , \] \+ in , \] \+ in \] Congress the amount of power 0 \[ any , \+ any \] particular Congress critter has *T*-2 is based *-4 on their seniority and how long they 've been there *T*-3 E_S

156025:16	I mean , the action is n't in West Virginia . E_S
156032:6	the world does not revolve around West Virginia uh , as far as this country is concerned *-1 , E_S
156039:12	and the C I A is \[ a , \+ a \] very large , very high profile agency
156096:74	so you have , uh , actually green trees and such that you do n't notice \[ that , \+ that \] other part of New Jersey exists . E_S
156132:8	a big issue is , you know , E_S 0 a lot of states do n't have a , uh , inspection law E_S
156135:63	Oh , \[ e- , \+ even \] where you do have the inspections *T*-1 , you know , the inspection is once a year . E_S
156141:6	and muffler falls off or something E_S
156145:6	and guy keeps *-1 driving along for long period of time after that . E_S
156259:97	Denver 's \[ \[ that , \+ that real good e- , \] \+ that real good , uh , example \] of * sitting in a valley , kind of like Mexico City does , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S
156263:6	Mexico City is historically been one of the worst \[ in the , \+ in the \] world for that . E_S
156349:8	NEW YORK TIMES is okay , E_S
156350:81	\[ but , \+ uh , and \] when you read a lot of this stuff *T*-1 , \[ the , \+ the \] quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so , E_S
156384:10	their editorial stand point seems *-1 to be a lot better than , say , your major network news and that kind of thing . E_S
156677:14	you know , Texas has one of the biggest criminal justice systems in the country . E_S
156763:57	But , * \[ \[ p- , \+ p- , \] \+ pumping \] more money into the school system is a good thing , E_S
156805:34	but a lot of it 's because everything 0 society wants *T*-1 , we are supposed *-2 to do *T*-3 . E_S
156841:9	certainly capital punishment is n't going *-1 to solve a lot of problems E_S
156977:16	Like , uh , San Francisco has \[ a , \+ a \] real , uh , strong AIDS support group and all that kind of stuff E_S
157024:72	and \[ it 's really , \+ it 's really \] not necessary , uh , \[ until , \+ until \] the , disease reaches its final stage , you know , becomes really infectious E_S
157036:46	I guess 0 I think \[ that , \+ that , \] uh , research is , I guess the most important , just because \[ I , \+ \] you know , \[ it , \+ it \] really needs *-1 to come to an end . You know . E_S
157046:26	So , uh , you know , my feeling is that , uh , it 's really being used *-1 today , E_S
157097:26	\[ \[ the , \+ the \] question is , \+ you know , the other \[ qu- , \+ problem \] with capital punishment 0 you run into *T*-1 is , \] what are you going *-2 to do *T*-5 about people who *T*-3 are later *-6 to have been found *-4 innocent , you know ? E_S
157109:179	\[ it , \+ I 've heard quotes , you know , it *EXP*-1 's \] better *ICH*-2 that a thousand people go free , than one person be unjustly imprisoned *-3 . I think 0 *T*-4 \[ i- , \+ is \] really \[ the , \+ the \] philosophy of the way 0 our legal system works *T*-1 . E_S
157114:25	the benefit of the doubt to the last iota is , uh , based *-2 on the , uh , person who *T*-1 is accused *-3 . E_S
157121:4	Tsongas is also saying , you know , \[ capital , \+ * make it *EXP*-1 a capital \] crime * to be a major drug dealer . E_S
157129:131	and , \[ \[ there , \+ there , \] \+ they \] seem that \[ \[ the profit marg- , \+ uh , drug dealers , \] \+ the profit margin 's \] so high that , yeah \[ the , \+ the \] risk is almost not there . E_S
157161:54	You know , \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ a \] sixty-two year old guy is less likely * to be put *-1 on death row from what I 've seen *T*-2 . E_S
157169:61	but you know , \[ \[ th- , \+ you know , what , \] \+ the \] important thing is that they be caught *-1 and not be a danger to society . E_S
157185:27	and , \[ the , \+ the \] other thing is that , you know ,
157195:46	So if someday we can go to Jeff Dahlmer and say , well , the problem is 0 \[ you , \+ you 've \] got an endorphin imbalance E_S
157290:15	The nice thing about autocrossing is 0 \[ you can , \+ you can \] do both . E_S
157292:4	Autocrossing is , N_S
157293:13	what kind of track is that *T*-1 ? E_S
157377:30	\[ the , \+ uh , the \] B M W is really , oh , like , oh , we have all these like high tech things E_S
157469:20	I think that , the general idea is * to \[ s- , \+ you know , spend , \] uh , during a time of recession \[ that , \+ \] you know , for the deficit spending to help *-1 pick up the economy , E_S
157494:84	But , uh , then again , uh , it 's \[ the , \+ \] hard *-1 to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends *T*-2 on all levels \[ of , \+ of , \] uh , government , including municipalities as well as state and federal governments . E_S
157499:158	and , so , \[ I , \+ I \] kind of do n't pay a proportionate amount of taxes \[ to , \+ \] I guess , uh , compared to what I get *T*-1 , because \[ I , \+ \] you know , all \[ my , \+ my \] education is state sponsored . E_S
157569:39	\[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes 0 you pay *T*-1 , I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S
157583:118	and \[ the , \+ \] what people need *-1 to understand *T*-2 in my opinion , now this is just my opinion , okay , uh , is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes . E_S
157630:65	Well , I 'd be curious as to what the , uh , requirement for \[ a , \+ an \] acquittal is *T*-1 . E_S
157637:53	, I mean , \[ it , \+ it \] fundamentally changes the way 0 the processing occurs *T*-2 because , uh , \[ the fact that it 's w- , \+ \[ the , \+ the \] principle is that the fact that it 's \] unanimous insures the beyond a reasonable doubt , uh , criterion that it , uh , increases \[ the , \+ the \] likelihood of * getting the proper judgment . E_S
157637:117	, I mean , \[ it , \+ it \] fundamentally changes the way 0 the processing occurs *T*-2 because , uh , \[ the fact that it 's w- , \+ \[ the , \+ the \] principle is that the fact that it 's \] unanimous insures the beyond a reasonable doubt , uh , criterion that it , uh , increases \[ the , \+ the \] likelihood of * getting the proper judgment . E_S
157683:246	Some of them did say that , you know , when they were the only one left * opposing the verdict *T*-1 , uh , you know , everyone was getting on them \[ so , \+ so \] heavily that eventually they just gave in *-4 knowing that nothing 0 they could do *T*-2 could stop it from * either being the verdict 0 everyone else was trying for *T*-3 or a hung jury because the one vote does n't mean anything except the ability * to not have a verdict . E_S
157718:11	and so my budget comes from my dad 's help . E_S
157726:8	so her budget is , uh , just , uh , planning for I R A 's . E_S
157748:63	and , uh , what we try and do *T*-1 * \[ to , \+ to \] stick to our monthly budget is 0 we pretty much have , you know , the house payment , E_S
158100:6	My husband is a physician , E_S
158135:24	\[ If , \+ if \] a woman is happy *-1 doing that , E_S
158255:28	Uh , \[ th- , \+ the \] other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent E_S
158255:42	Uh , \[ th- , \+ the \] other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent E_S
158349:44	\[ the whole , \+ the whole point \] of * being on a jury is * to convict \[ \[ or , \+ or , \] \+ or , \] uh , let * go based on \[ whether , or not the person , \+ whether or not the evidence \] says , that there 's enough , E_S
158387:16	Unfortunately that kind of thing is not limited to a big city like Los Angeles . E_S
158506:45	And they had a good system like so when you walked in *T*-1 , everything looks cool . E_S
158742:153	the cynical side of me says that , you know , it was more *ICH*-1 for , uh , \[ the , \+ the \] domestic political situation *ICH*-2 than for anything else . You know , \[ and that , \+ \] you know , and for * portraying Bush is a strong President . E_S
158750:77	Uh , I mean \[ \[ I really , \+ I really \] think \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ my gut feeling is \[ that , \+ that , \] \] you know , he pretty much \[ picked , \+ picked \] the fight \[ with , \+ uh , with , \] um , Hussein . E_S
159004:4	Everybody says that . E_S
159296:98	Well , how do you feel *T*-2 about * setting , like , well , for example , \[ a car type accident where , \+ uh , or some incident \] where someone loses a limb *T*-1 . E_S
159313:22	And there may be where the judiciary is a little more learned about that type of thing *T*-2 because they can be schooled *-1 in that kind of thing , E_S
159326:39	because if they wheel somebody into a courtroom and the jury 's heart goes out to that person and they do one of these mega awards , it really , you know , ultimately is not penalizing the person that they 're trying *T*-1 for get away . E_S
159334:9	Unless the award is so staggering that it goes all beyond their layers of insurance which *T*-1 is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages *T*-2 , E_S

160153:84	And , uh , I guess , uh , 0 first and foremost , \[ it , \+ really it 's \] a question of what *ICH*-3 the student wants *-1 to have *T*-2 in the way of a career and then , uh , uh , which colleges or universities *T*-4 can best offer that program , E_S
160196:22	at least , the university here in Saskatoon is primarily , uh , off campus resident students . E_S
160203:104	Uh , you know , I know that there are a lot of colleges and universities *ICH*-3 , particularly as they get *-1 to be a little bit on the smaller side where dormitory life is , uh , is right on campus as well *T*-2 E_S

160799:19	I do n't think 0 anybody pays too little . E_S
160829:35	but I 'll bet 0 that means 0 your state sales tax is pretty high . E_S
160841:8	The only problem is 0 I work in Massachusetts , E_S
160860:15	But , uh , the problem is that \[ so \+ \] I 'm paying state tax even if I do n't live here . E_S
160916:19	there are things 0 government does *T*-1 better , you know , E_S
160917:14	I think 0 government does a better space program than you 're going *-1 to get *?* out of private individuals , E_S
160921:88	but , you know , I think , you know , 0 you look at things like , you know , tax subsidies to tobacco farmers because Jesse Helms wants it that way E_S
160936:26	You know , I think 0 the military is really fat . E_S
160955:14	it seems like everything is really screwy right now as far as \[ the economy , \+ uh , the government *ICH*-1 \] goes and \[ our , \+ our \] whole economy in general E_S
160983:22	But , you know , the other thing is , 0 it 's tricky , though , E_S
160994:7	Grotten Connecticut goes , E_S
161082:22	and he says , well , my dog does n't like cats , E_S
161134:4	Everybody seems *-1 to be really happy with them . E_S
161173:61	\[ \[ I , \+ I 'd , \] \+ I \] really do n't know what the best pet is *T*-1 . E_S
161296:21	\[ The , \+ the \] ferret is used to *-1 running the house and was kind of wild E_S
161341:13	the , uh , subject is child care and how * to determine child care *T*-1 , E_S
161376:8	because somebody has a child or , uh , likes children does n't really mean that they 're qualified *-1 to give the child the kind of supervision and training \[ that \+ that , \] uh , N_S
161393:71	And the other thing that *T*-1 's difficult in , uh , it 's *RNR*-2 a too small setting , like a day care center is * to find the right program of enrichment for the child , because you do n't want *-3 to just warehouse the child , E_S
161396:51	and \[ that , \+ that \] includes , uh , an atmosphere in which the child is safe \[ and , \+ and \] he 's watched *-1 and his physical needs are cared for *-2 *T*-3 , E_S
161400:11	when a couple has a child *T*-2 , then \[ they should both take , \+ you say 0 the first four or five years are the most important , and I think 0 I would agree with that , they both take \] four or five years off and devote to parenting . E_S

161473:13	Uh , R E M makes me laugh because they 've gone from a college radio progressive group to *-1 being , uh , you know , ultra mainstream at this point , E_S
161726:17	So , where about in Texas is that *T*-1 ? E_S
161747:4	Dallas is south . E_S
161945:28	I mean , I guess , 0 any crime is too much E_S
162352:25	and , \[ s- , \+ the \] dealer comes out *-1 okay you know , E_S
162385:6	The pay is n't fabulous , E_S
162473:24	\[ and , \+ and \] the dental plan is fabulous . E_S

162543:22	one of the things with my company is that they 've , uh , got a reputation for a lot of job security E_S
162635:38	Uh , it seems *-2 to be that , uh , gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of poverty conditions . E_S
162715:37	I do n't know \[ what , \+ what \] the solution is *T*-1 . E_S
162780:72	but then , the more 0 I thought about it *T*-1 , the more sense it made *T*-2 , is that , uh , alcohol is as bad a drug as anything else . E_S
162821:24	at times I feel that a unanimous decision is warranted , especially in cases in which there 's no smoking gun *T*-1 . E_S
162858:56	Well , I mean , I think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served *-2 *T*-1 . E_S
162920:28	\[ \[ I , \+ uh , my sister has a , \] \+ she just had a \] baby , E_S

163623:41	\[ and the , \+ and \[ the , \+ the \] \] procedure is utterly humiliating . E_S

164853:23	My wife , uh , on the other hand is home most of the day E_S

165043:45	and the parents might not could even tell you what their kid 's teacher 's name is *T*-1 . You know , E_S
165242:7	because technology is so , uh , you know , volatile and changing all the time . E_S
165269:8	and the MacIntosh is about the only one that *T*-1 's going right *-2 forcing I B M and the rest of the D O S world to follow along . E_S

165542:6	my wife handles a lot of the day to day finances E_S

165980:52	\[ \[ the , \+ the \] \+ I 'd say 0 the \] most important thing is a car that *T*-1 's not going *-2 to fall apart . That *T*-3 does n't have problems . E_S

166139:18	Do you think that the individual has as much time as they did , * let 's say , ten , twenty years ago ? E_S
166306:90	But then , again , I 'm not quite sure where the blame ought *-1 to be put *-1 *T*-2 . Uh , because \[ the , \+ the \] dropout rate is , in those areas , w- , N_S
166439:13	now that Steve Largent is gone , I kind of lose a little bit for them E_S
166476:6	College football is a little bit different E_S
166505:70	\[ I , \+ * to be honest with you , I \] find \[ th- , \+ that \] too much running gets pretty boring as well E_S

166613:4	Rugby is something else . E_S
166625:4	Rugby is definitely big in college E_S because it 's something 0 a bunch of fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do *T*-1 . E_S
166731:77	Well , uh , one of the things \[ that , \+ uh , that \] I found *T*-1 to be , uh , an invasion is when I pay for something with a credit card *T*-2 and they ask me *-3 to put my telephone number \[ on the , \+ on the , \] uh , credit card bill *T*-2 . E_S
166776:90	And I think that , \[ it , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] one thing \[ f- , \+ * to , \] uh , voluntarily give it because someone asks . E_S
166795:26	* \[ en- , \+ enhancing \] revenue is the , uh , phrase 0 they use *T*-1 . E_S
166860:43	I mean , it *EXP*-1 's one thing that I , and the college knows that E_S
166885:6	My grandfather is ninety-two years old . E_S
166921:97	\[ And \+ and , \] \[ for , \+ for , \] I 'm sure , a lot of people going into a nursing home it 's like * saying my life is over E_S
166971:48	Actually , * to tell you the truth , I think , uh , 0 jury selection is a , uh , prime , uh , discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on , uh , uh , finding of , uh , guilt . E_S
167026:21	So , that 's why the defense is there *-1 picking through them *T*-4 , whereas at the same time , \[ the , \+ uh , the \] prosecutor sitting there *-3 picking through them because he wants somebody who *T*-2 will give him , uh , a guilty verdict if the facts warrant . E_S
167030:29	So , uh , I think 0 the jury selection process is pretty neat , E_S
167047:50	Maybe just the judge because they 're the people who *T*-1 know what the system is *T*-2 and what it 's all about *T*-3 and believe in the system . E_S
167066:28	Well , preceding criminal record , according to the judicial process has nothing 0 * to do *T*-1 with the current crime . E_S
167161:13	But 0 the point is *T*-1 is that businesses do that . E_S
167197:36	Uh , but , if that 's the case , if the business is responsible for *-3 policing themselves , then I think 0 some well defined mechanisms need *-1 to be in place so that , uh , the opportunity \[ f- , \+ \] * to forget that you owe sales tax for something , uh , can be avoided *-2 . E_S
167264:27	if you do n't terminate him , the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person . E_S
167264:50	if you do n't terminate him , the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person . E_S
167274:12	So if this guy does n't make a great deal of money , which *T*-1 is often times the case , \[ then \+ then \] he 's obviously not worth very much E_S
167278:6	His life is n't worth very much then . E_S
167308:25	of course , a parent losing a teenage child is about as bad as it could possibly get *?* , I think 0 *T*-1 , in terms of psychological impact . E_S
167399:8	And one thing is that \[ \[ we 're , \+ we had , \] \+ we were \] going *-1 to pour the basement foundation . E_S
167518:27	Uh , \[ it 's , \+ the house is \] eighty years old E_S
167582:28	We have a very detailed budget . Because my husband is a finance major . E_S
167611:6	My husband is a finance major also . E_S
167617:74	Uh , and \[ \[ \[ we budget , \+ we 're , \] \+ our , \] \+ our new thing to our budget is \] 0 we just had a baby . E_S
167667:6	That money goes into there . E_S
167713:71	\[ and , \+ uh , and so \] now when we have *-1 to come up with that deductible that our insurance does n't cover *T*-2 *T*-4 rather than * wondering where it 's going *-5 to come from *T*-3 , E_S
167721:119	And \[ when , \+ when \] we see something on sale *T*-1 , uh , instead of * just looking in our checking account and saying well we 've got enough and getting it , and then when something comes up *T*-2 , you know , kind of scrimping * to pay for a medical bill . Everything 's taken care of *-3 . E_S
167791:26	as far as like big things like something comes up and you have *-1 to buy a T V or a big item , like for the house . E_S
167840:71	And \[ I , \+ well , I \] guess 0 you could say 0 one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools . E_S
167853:41	Uh , although I I 'm sure 0 to some extent , that money is part of the problem in the disparity , E_S
167872:58	I mean , \[ in the , \+ in those \] places where , uh , like the economy is really bad *T*-1 , they might , you know , be more tempted *-2 \[ to , \+ to \] quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the , you know , money *-3 to put food on the table and stuff like that .

167915:62	You know , I guess 0 \[ the whole , \+ the whole \] environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the MUMBLEx people . E_S

168051:25	\[ We have a lot , \+ population is a lot \] lighter up here . E_S

168221:56	\[ Which \+ \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] \] what recycling at home sorting does *T*-1 , you know . E_S

168323:27	up here \[ the , \+ the \] city provides them . E_S

168620:6	the cost is something E_S
168640:33	I guess 0 what *T*-1 worries me about capital punishment is , uh , 0 when I see people enthusiastic about it and , uh , uh , sort of bloodthirsty *T*-2 . I think 0 it brings out the worst \[ in the , \+ in the \] people who *T*-3 do the punishing E_S
168782:23	Uh , I guess 0 our big outlet is music .

168798:68	So there 's \[ plenty of , \+ plenty of \] interactive time in , uh , * practicing . Although neither kid likes *-1 to practice . E_S

169011:41	Uh , well , you know , uh , I think 0 public service is a worthy thing E_S
169020:39	Uh , I know that \[ f- , \+ \] because my son is \[ a , \+ a \] scout now and , uh , is thinking about his Eagle E_S
169025:47	and you have *-1 to do a public service project . Uh , in which leadership is the key element *T*-2 . E_S
169043:24	of course , uh , uh , military service falls under the category , uh , of a public service . E_S

169148:30	and in Orlando , \[ there 's , \+ crime is \] getting *-1 to be a bigger problem than ever , E_S
169210:32	it 's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because everybody went to work *T*-1 , you know , E_S

169459:130	If you were deeply involved in it , then you immediately realize that what they print *T*-1 is stuff that you probably knew *T*-5 already and the stuff that you want *T*-2 they 're not printing *T*-4 because the average person does n't need or want *-3 to know that much . E_S
169577:27	Uh , it seems to me that the judge does it E_S
169656:8	if somebody gets the death penalty , \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] judged *-1 guilty , E_S
169741:13	My , uh , cousin is a F B I agent down in Miami . E_S
169851:18	and I think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time . E_S
169865:38	and if they would just say oh , this person 's drug test is positive we wo n't hire them you know . Then you could lose out on a job when really you did n't do anything *T*-1 . E_S
169978:39	Well \[ my , \+ uh , uh , my \] wife 's grandmother is in a nursing home in , uh , Minnesota E_S
170201:43	and I figure that , \+ \] so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what *T*-1 's really there . E_S
170348:4	unemployment is good E_S
170465:12	And my thirteen year old is pretty separate from her brother and sisters E_S
170498:35	My next oldest daughter that *T*-1 's in college in California is a world twirling champion . E_S
170535:9	like my son is in , uh , Little League this year . E_S
170605:32	and I do n't think 0 our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some . E_S
170607:4	Atlanta is horrible . E_S
170619:6	the housing is so cheap in comparison to Boston that they jump on it . E_S
170630:48	Then when they get down here *T*-1 , they realize 0 the cost of living is outrageous compared \[ to , \+ to \] where they came from *T*-2 . E_S
170637:6	The housing is cheaper , E_S
170689:4	Woman goes in E_S
170720:6	and everything is wrong with it . E_S
170721:20	I mean , the power steering fluid leaks ,
170722:6	the oil leaks ,
170723:8	the brake fluid leaks , you know , E_S
170741:85	But , uh , you know , I hate *-1 to go into \[ a , \+ a \] repair place because they 'll tell me 0 something is wrong with it and it 's not *?* , you know , and *-2 charge me twice as much . E_S
170869:99	I do n't know whether that 's because they , you know , sort of give up hope once they get in there or what \[ the , \+ the \] reason is *T*-1 . E_S
170870:36	But I think 0 the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home *T*-1 is only like six months or something . E_S
170948:30	Well maybe that 's the purpose of the nursing home is * to have them go someplace where they can see that it 's not worth * continuing *T*-1 . E_S
171030:68	Uh , \[ I , \+ you know , I \] think 0 those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them *T*-1 E_S
171038:8	And another thing is cost . E_S
171064:16	I think 0 my wife is much better *ICH*-1 than I am *?* at that walking into a place and getting a feeling for whether it is a loving and caring place or not E_S
171097:36	And \[ I think 0 you have , \+ the main thing is that you have \] *-1 to determine that they 're perfectly open . That you 're welcome anytime without notice , in the middle of the day and so forth E_S
171199:49	And I recently read an article on just this , that *T*-1 said 0 stress today is so much worse . E_S
171279:21	and I do n't think that America is currently the type of environment where * struggling up from the bottom is necessarily considered *-1 to be good *T*-2 . E_S
171279:62	and I do n't think that America is currently the type of environment where * struggling up from the bottom is necessarily considered *-1 to be good *T*-2 . E_S
171298:59	Uh , I know 0 what I 'm seeing *T*-1 here at \[ m- , \+ my \] job is that people are having their children much later in life so that they 're establishing careers E_S
171310:16	Uh , trial by jury is good E_S
171359:34	I think 0 maybe \[ th- , \+ a \] judge is a better judge of that E_S
171368:21	\[ Th- , \+ the \] sentencing is really light compared to what I think 0 they should be *T*-1 in a lot of cases you know ,
171379:74	But people who *T*-4 \[ d- , \+ do n't \] have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like *T*-1 and what the options are *T*-2 , * to ask them *-3 to decide for one case , on one person , based on what they see *T*-5 , I think 0 that is maybe , uh , a little bit naive . E_S
171392:137	but \[ I guess , \+ I guess \] 0 I like the system that they have *T*-1 in some places where the defendant \[ gets *-3 to choose whether he 's , \+ goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets *T*-2 to choose \] it *T*-4 . E_S
171406:10	But , the thing is too , 0 maybe they need \[ more of a , \+ I do n't know , more of a \] expert types \[ to , \+ to \] be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick , you know , Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever \[ an- , \+ and \] call them in . E_S
171484:6	My daughter has a charm bracelet 0 I bought her *T*-1 that *T*-2 's guaranteed *-3 .
171557:4	Service is more of a problem . E_S
171585:9	like the customer is always right E_S
171841:40	\[ and \+ and , \] uh , I do n't think 0 anybody roots differently E_S
171873:36	They say , uh , 0 \[ i- , \+ \] football attracts more men because of \[ \[ \[ the , \+ you know , \[ y- , \+ \] the , \] \+ you see the , \] \+ the \] physical aggression on the field E_S
171923:4	Nobody talks about it E_S
171926:14	There 's no professional hockey teams \[ in , \+ in \] Texas MUMBLEx . E_S
172102:8	the other side presents their case E_S
172202:79	Well , uh , in the case of , civil , uh , things , I think maybe \[ the , \+ the \] use of the jury is very , often to the lawyer 's advantage E_S
172353:31	and I really sort of have the feeling that word processing is a big market for home computing . E_S
172364:16	even the computer at work is primarily a , uh , word processing system and a communication system . E_S
172381:31	\[ that 's , \+ that \] and word processing is N_S
172451:60	Well , \[ \[ \[ i- , \+ if , \] \+ if , \] \+ if \] the interface is there so that it 's like fun 0 * to use *T*-1 and the challenge , N_S
172481:51	and then \[ w- , \+ after five minutes when \] the , uh , uh , voice comes on *T*-1 , we can talk all night if we want . E_S
172508:19	Well , I mean , nobody taxes groceries . E_S
172564:18	I think 0 the other problem is , you know , 0 \[ it , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] easy * to complain about taxes because there 's something 0 you , theoretically , can do something about *T*-2 . E_S
172651:22	\[ * Belonging to a group is the , \+ * belonging to a health group is probably the \] most important protection 0 you can have *T*-1 after you , N_S

172670:9	Now my husband is with , uh , Northwest Airlines E_S
172685:32	uh , and then , uh , uh , if the cleaning does n't get you , the orthodony will *?* . E_S
172699:158	And \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 it 's really something that \[ the , \+ uh , the \] government ought *-6 to encourage *T*-1 more because , uh , there are all these complaints about how we 're not a saving country *T*-2 and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in , uh , Germany and Japan *T*-5 .
172708:89	\[ When you have the , \+ when you have \[ the , \+ uh , the \] \] economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has *T*-1 *T*-2 , \[ and \+ \] you can , uh , offer some incentive E_S
172709:12	and if the government goes along by *-1 not taxing it when you put it aside *T*-2 you can really build up , uh , the savings \[ and the , \+ that \] you would n't otherwise do *T*-3 E_S
172730:49	Uh , \[ I , their , \+ uh , I know 0 their \] maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which I think 0 *T*-1 is too short . Uh E_S
172744:13	And , uh the infant needs her desperately , at that point and time . E_S
172760:65	\[ and , \+ uh , and \] yet anybody who *T*-2 's gotten far enough * to get a good salary is really reluctant *-1 to give that up . E_S
172821:8	The only trouble is that you can afford *-1 to go anywhere E_S
172983:43	but still their taxes are so high , that , you know , my father does n't feel like he can retire because they could n't pay their taxes . E_S
173020:17	and , uh , the family car is \[ a , \+ uh , a \] Dodge Caravan . \[ And , \+ uh , because \] we have three kids and they 're under thirteen E_S
173101:60	and we were real happy with that because , uh , \[ my , \+ my \] second requirement after price is , uh , low maintenance . E_S
173322:28	Uh , well it seems to me that kindergarten is now the equivalent of first grade . E_S
173326:6	My son leaves the house at seven thirty and does n't get home until three o'clock . E_S
173442:4	Texas wants very badly *-1 to be considered *-2 tops in the school system E_S
173485:8	And my feeling is that , you know , you 're only a kid once , and you do n't want *-1 to spend your whole life in school . E_S
173500:29	I think 0 we should do what Europe does *T*-1 and include cultural activities in our school system . E_S
173557:38	That 's why they want them there *T*-1 because them somebody takes care of them all day . E_S
173586:20	but I think 0 the appeal process is really getting in the way . E_S
173592:33	Well I think that currently the way 0 the law stands *T*-1 is n't so much that the laws are enforceable or not , E_S
173610:58	Uh , \[ but \+ or \] whether \[ there 's just , \+ you know , a policeman has just \] made \[ \[ \[ a , \+ uh , a , \] \+ you know , a \] non , \+ a noncritical error , \] though be it not the right way 0 * to do it *T*-1 N_S
173618:77	I mean \[ \[ our , \+ uh , our , \] \+ our \] glorious , uh , you know , mayor here in Washington is six days away from *-1 getting \[ out of , \+ out of \] the can E_S
173635:25	and the whole idea behind the current criminal process system is * to protect those who actually *T*-1 did n't the crimes , albeit it seems that we are failing \[ in that , \+ in that \] ultimate goal because there are times when people who *T*-2 are guilty are getting off *T*-3 . E_S
173683:60	Uh , but I guess 0 I feel more like whatever you 're doing *T*-1 in your own private life is your own private business . E_S
173737:35	\[ I , \+ I \] must admit that the production costs \[ of , \+ of \] these drugs \[ are , \+ are \] zippo compared to the street market costs \[ and , \+ and \] the costs to society , E_S
173761:34	The tighter 0 you squeeze *T*-3 , the more the price goes up *T*-2 , the more incentive there is *T*-1 . E_S
173816:4	Everybody cares about the education 0 the kids are getting *T*-1 . E_S
173832:22	The , uh , problem with public education is \[ really , \+ uh , really \] a problem with the culture . E_S
173840:49	I think 0 \[ that 's , \+ uh , that 's \] the principal problem is that , uh , people no longer see it \[ as , \+ uh , as \] their problem E_S
173844:41	It *EXP*-2 troubles me too \[ tha- , \+ that \] the priority seems *-1 to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good E_S
173845:40	and by definition , for some of us , at least , the public good includes * having an educated populace and then idea that , uh , you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes \[ in the , \+ at the \] local level or bigger votes at the national level . E_S
173884:83	But , uh , \[ the , \+ uh , uh , now the \] only thing 0 people seem *-1 to agree on *T*-2 is that education is , uh , an economic enterprise 0 *T*-3 to train people for jobs . E_S
173885:55	And , uh , I 'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is *T*-1 . E_S
174017:10	If my husband golfs , you know , he 'll do it during nap time ,
174191:21	Uh , I guess 0 the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that *T*-2 or how we would change it *T*-1 . E_S
174331:33	And it 's like \[ the , \+ the \] truth is n't really important anymore . E_S
174383:6	And Louisiana is completely different cause it was based *-1 on the , N_S what is it *T*-1 , E_S it 's based *-1 on common law E_S
174384:17	and the rest of the country is not *?* or something like that . E_S
174549:8	The only problem is , of course , that , uh , that requires significant commitment from people * to actually decide 0 they want *-1 to put things like that up there . E_S
174650:4	Texas is *?* too . E_S
174688:18	in fact , a big gubernatorial issue is \[ the \+ the \] turnover rates of , uh , \[ r- , \+ uh , repeat \] offenders being let *-1 out and doing it again . E_S
174745:58	\[ I , \+ yeah I \] tend *-1 to think 0 the repeal system for the death penalty is a \[ little , \+ little \] too lenient . E_S
174842:11	uh , the military does n't execute anymore E_S
174851:24	So , I think 0 about the only one is , uh , rape , E_S
174889:65	And I guess 0 the only drawback *ICH*-2 0 I can see *T*-1 \[ to , \+ to \] drug testing is \[ in , \+ 0 in \] case you are on some sort of medication that *T*-3 might give some , uh , sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem . E_S
174906:6	Another thing is , 0 a lot of times , you know , they are n't that accurate . E_S
175018:42	Uh , \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 the unwritten rule is , yeah , * expect it E_S
175048:28	Uh , I 'm not sure where *ICH*-2 Georgia ranks *T*-1 in the nation E_S
175060:8	But the system does n't allow for the corrections . E_S
175078:8	And Cobb County is better than the county 0 I 'm in *T*-1 . E_S
175295:11	Uh , every person has their opinions E_S
175296:19	and that 's why jury selection is often very difficult *T*-1 . Uh . E_S
175336:18	You know , if someone is ill , N_S
175342:6	Plea bargaining is something completely different . E_S
175371:38	\[ I , \+ and I \] think 0 if a person is guilty of *-1 taking someone 's life and like you say , \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ there 's \] no doubt whatsoever . Like drunk drivers that *T*-2 kill people E_S
175414:10	the , appeal procedure is the only thing 0 I can possibly think of *T*-1 . E_S
175444:47	Well , \[ w- , \+ do \] you think 0 people should have a trial is they 're caught *-1 *-2 dead to rights like , N_S
175447:34	\[ I , \+ I \] feel that \[ everyone is , \+ everyone is , \] uh , entitled *-1 to a trial by jury . E_S

175473:34	\[ and , \+ and , \] you know , the pay is regular E_S
175475:143	And \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ uh , that \] anybody could get *T*-1 \[ in , \+ in \] * dealing with a large company is * to be in a situation where \[ you , \+ you \] get *-4 to know what *T*-2 's going on *T*-3 . E_S
175499:54	You know , I 'm pretty much on a low level as far as , uh , the company is concerned . E_S
175544:69	\[ \[ And , \+ and , \] \+ but \] of course \[ most time , \+ most of the time \] management has a hard time * distributing or getting the word out to the people who *T*-1 must know . E_S
175546:59	Or you might *?* , you know , if it does n't impact you directly . Or if your management does n't think that . N_S
175563:11	and pretty soon somebody falls off . E_S
175614:45	and , you know , next thing 0 you know *T*-1 , uh , someone calls and wants *-2 to sell you this or that E_S
175859:8	And that tradition is still , N_S
175873:32	But , uh , \[ my , \+ my \] only complaint is 0 I really do n't enough time * \[ to , \+ to \] look at the articles every day \[ and , \+ and \] go through a paper , you know , exhaust the details . E_S
175916:15	A lot of my information comes from several sources . E_S
175917:20	Probably pretty high up on the list is *T*-1 National Public Radio . Uh , which I like *T*-2 . E_S
176034:49	actually what *T*-1 happens \[ is , \+ uh , is , \] 0 my check gets automatically deposited *-2 . E_S
176054:60	You know , well \[ \[ a- , \+ a- , \] \+ actually \] that kind of situation is just wonderful for budgets . Is n't it *?* ? E_S
176105:36	and you know , \[ if , \+ if \] something goes on sale and I do n't have the money , I still do n't buy it . E_S
176168:16	I mean N_S that rug is thirteen years old , E_S
176208:112	and \[ \[ w- , \+ why , \] \+ why \] would they be interested \[ in , \+ in \] your little turnip unless , you know , one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is well 0 that 's somebody 0 * to molest *T*-1 , you know *T*-2 . E_S
176231:64	\[ And , \+ but \] as you pointed out , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 the real problem is the low pay child facilities E_S
176336:20	but boy three hundred dollars a week does n't go very far on child care . E_S
176344:8	my youngest child is eight . E_S
176448:16	I mean , the baby is like seventeen months E_S
176464:15	and , uh , her mother stays home E_S
176465:85	and \[ \[ she , \+ they \] live , \+ they live \] with us . You know , \[ in , \+ \] as Orange County is really expensive . E_S
176538:6	and kindergarten starts at eleven thirty E_S
176605:6	my employer does not do that . Uh , although , uh , I had an ex-employer that , N_S
176612:6	My feeling is that certain jobs that when there 's immediate threat to life and limb , uh , if should somebody be under the influence of drugs *T*-1 , \[ I , \+ I 'd \] be willing *-2 to support that . E_S
176634:68	\[ it , \+ to me , no matter how much \[ \[ the , \+ th- , \] \+ our \] company claims 0 it 's \] not a constitutional issue . That , because this is , uh , between a company and an employee \[ it is not , \+ it is not \] a government *T*-1 , E_S
176636:6	the Constitution does n't apply . E_S
176639:83	Uh , and so \[ it 's , \+ it 's required for certain , \] \+ \[ some form , \+ some form \] of drug program is required \] * to get the government contracts E_S
176770:6	My wife wishes 0 I had n't done that . E_S
176796:69	so \[ \[ I , \+ my , \] \+ my \] vast experience of \[ home , \+ home \] owner 's knowledge is not very much . E_S
176956:35	it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is *T*-1 , you know . E_S
176993:34	so I do n't really know what the cost of living is even like *T*-1 in Dallas anymore . E_S
177003:4	gas is a \[ dollar t- , \+ dollar twelve \] a gallon , E_S
177011:8	my current project is a walkway which I 'm building *T*-1 *ICH*-2 around the house and out to the backyard \[ to , \+ \] uh , you know , *-3 digging it out and laying sand and putting , uh , pavers on top of that E_S

177058:31	And , uh , uh , just like the burning and looting is self-destruct . E_S
177062:4	Everybody says well this is the nineties E_S
177129:22	\[ And , \+ and \] my reaction is 0 I would have run over fifty people \[ before , \+ \] rather than stop . E_S

177224:60	\[ The problem with , \+ uh , and I think 0 one of the problems with \] immigration policy is like any other political problem is that people are not willing *-1 to discuss it , uh , \[ in , \+ in \] terms of what , uh , *T*-2 really is driving it . E_S

177226:73	I mean right now , uh , I believe 0 there are two policies \[ that , \+ uh , that \] the government uses *T*-1 *-2 to modulate immigration .
177247:15	And then the , third thing is , uh , the political aspect of , uh , uh , * letting steam come out from under the lid in Mexico . E_S
177338:20	And , you know , one guy comes around with his truck \[ and , \+ and \] dumps it all in there . E_S
177352:15	and , uh , landfill space is , in deed , the driving factor here . E_S
177353:49	And , in fact , uh , despite all of our open space out here , landfill space is still , uh , very hard 0 * to come by *T*-1 . E_S
177360:65	I mean \[ there , \+ there 's \] got *-3 to be a crevice between two mountains that nobody gives a doggone about *T*-1 that \[ you could , \+ you could \] use *T*-2 for landfill . MUMBLEx . E_S
177421:39	Uh , \[ and , \+ uh , and \] * limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than * limiting the weight . E_S
177425:11	Well my exercise program consists of , uh , you know , N_S
177701:58	\[ what , \+ what 's \] your opinion of \[ wha- , \+ what \] a good router is like *T*-1 *T*-2 ? E_S
