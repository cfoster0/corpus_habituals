29571:24	fiancee	fiancee	takes	fiancee	and my, my fiancee takes probably six sunday papers.	###speakerb116.###i figure 0 i'm only taking on the weekend,###and i can afford that.###speakera117.###yeah.###speakerb118.### i, i find the news reporting in the morning news to be better,###but i sort of have a liberal political slant,###and the morning news just has an incredibly conservative editorial, um, outlook.###speakera119.
29766:35	the fabric	fabric	is	fabric	and it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped *-1 in *t*-2 and then, um, allowed *-1 to dry in those, those draping bows, i mean, those draping streamers.	###speakera55.###oh, definitely,###yeah.###speakerb56.###when i do, um, crochet *t*-1, it's usually the lacy victorian type things like that,###speakera57.###oh.###speakerb58.###and i stiffen those with a, a glue mixture.###it's like white glue,
29781:19	my concern	concern	is	concern	do you know what my concern is *t*-1?	###i was just.###there's bound *-1 to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that *t*-2's very similar that *t*-3's not going *-4 to melt too much with, uh, uh, high humidity, in a room,###speakera61.###yeah.###speakerb62.###speakera63.### that's i think 0 that's what my concern was *t*-1, was it really sure, and how they would, how they would last *t*-2.###speakerb64.###speakera65.###speakerb66.
29879:27	the pattern	pattern	is	pattern	i can't really watch television if the pattern is very intricate.	###i do know.###speakera95.###yeah.###speakerb96.###i have done a little bit of that,###but i decided that that's something that *t*-1 demands my tim-, my, my total attention.###speakera97.###uh-huh.###speakerb98.###and so i've got *-1 to have total, almost total silence.
30053:104	my american express card	card	is	card	i know 0 when i travel *t*-1, or when i used *-2 to travel overseas quite a bit *t*-3, what i would do *t*-4 on my american express card is before i would, before i left i would mail a check to, to american express and, you know, have some idea of how much *t*-5 was there, you know,	###but, uh, i try, a-, as with the american express, i try *-1 to pay it, you know, as it comes in.###speakera29.###right.###right.###speakerb30.###so, uh,###speakera31.### it's, it *exp*-1's not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill.###that's usually how we do it *t*-1.###speakerb32.
30214:21	your speech	speech	is	speech	your, your speech is very exact.	###so, when i heard that jack was going *-1 to do this *t*-2, i called him and asked for an application where i could participate in this *t*-3.###speakera105.###yeah,###yeah.###speakerb106.###and, so that's how i got involved *t*-1.###speakera107.###yeah.###you have a very, um, very,###what's the word *t*-1.
30391:19	my boss	boss	has	boss	now i know 0 my boss has bought the software, um, that he can, that his checkbook is on, on on a disk,	###so.###speakera45.###right.###she could just as easily do those things by hand.###speakerb46.###yeah,###just as quickly.###speakera47.###yeah.###speakerb48.
30391:69	his checkbook	checkbook	is	checkbook	now i know 0 my boss has bought the software, um, that he can, that his checkbook is on, on on a disk,	###so.###speakera45.###right.###she could just as easily do those things by hand.###speakerb46.###yeah,###just as quickly.###speakera47.###yeah.###speakerb48.

30605:69	addition	addition	is	addition	you know, she keeps, you know keeps several weeks' worth of data and then in addition is keeping copies of all the changes *-2 to show, you know, * look, this didn't really need *-1 to be changed *-3.	###and it's like, you know, it's ridiculous###and that was, that was the high week,###but it's running about seventy which *t*-1 is still ridiculous * to have *-3 to make changes to seventy percent of everything that she types *t*-2.###speakera119.###uh-huh.###speakerb120.###speakera121.###well, it *ich*-1's good that she does that, i mean, bring it to people's attention.###speakerb122.###well, that's exactly right.
30880:21	the rating system	system	seems	system	it's just that the rating system seems, you know,	###speakera63.###well, i have no objections to it.###it's just, uh,###and it's a matter of your taste, uh,###speakerb64.###yeah,###yeah.###oh, yeah.###it's just that,###yeah,
30997:42	the second one	one	follows	one	uh, if, if that is that the second one follows the first.	###all the tricks.###speakera103.###speakerb104.###uh-huh.###that sounds like an interesting concept.###speakera105.###but you need *-1 to rent the first one first.###speakerb106.###* to understand what *t*-1's going on in the second?###speakera107.
31149:49	a subject matter	matter	does	matter	that's pretty interesting because just, just because you know a subject matter doesn't mean 0 you can teach it.	###speakera28.###and somebody said, well, you know, you could go in and, and substitute teach at seventy-five dollars a day###and there's always going *-1 to be, you know, somebody having a need for a math or science teacher.###i thought, christ, they're letting me in, * to, you know,###speakerb29.###yeah.###speakera30.### this would be, this would be frightening.###i don't know anything about it.###speakerb31.
31160:62	today	today	is	today	in fact, i think 0 that's, that's one of the big problems today is the, the way 0 the kids behave or act *t*-2 and, and the way 0 they are sometimes disinterested in what *t*-1's going on in the class and disruptive *t*-3.	###speakera32.###speakerb33.###speakera34.###right.###speakerb35.###speakera36.###right.###and even if i knew how * to teach the subject matter *t*-1, i don't know if i'd know how * to handle that kind of a, a group of kids *t*-2.###speakerb37.###oh, yeah.
31184:33	next year	year	is	year	my god, i think 0 it would be next year is what i'd read *t*-1.	###what i'm seeing *t*-1 now, uh, in terms of kindergarten preparedness, just from, in, in, in different preschools it's like day and night.###speakerb43.###uh-huh.###speakera44.###and i wonder, how do they handle a child who *t*-1 is obviously very ready and another child who *t*-2 doesn't even speak english, let alone know her colors *t*-3.###speakerb45.###yeah.###speakera46.###and they're in the same classrooms.###and i guess also 0 you're going *-1 to see the first of the, uh, crack kids starting kindergarten.
31227:9	nobody	nobody	has	nobody	nobody has, nobody has a nongifted child.	###speakera58.###well, you know, you, you sit here###and you think about that.###at the same time you think, god, i hope 0 i don't sound like a stage mother because, right now if you ask my friends t-, put twenty mothers in a room and ask them how many *t*-2 have gifted children, you're going *-1 to have twenty hands, you know, up there.###speakerb59.###speakera60.###speakerb61.###oh, you're kidding.###speakera62.###oh, no.
31227:20	nobody	nobody	has	nobody	nobody has, nobody has a nongifted child.	###speakera58.###well, you know, you, you sit here###and you think about that.###at the same time you think, god, i hope 0 i don't sound like a stage mother because, right now if you ask my friends t-, put twenty mothers in a room and ask them how many *t*-2 have gifted children, you're going *-1 to have twenty hands, you know, up there.###speakerb59.###speakera60.###speakerb61.###oh, you're kidding.###speakera62.###oh, no.
31277:68	their child	child	is	child	there's such a, a push among young mothers these days *-1 to make * sure 0 their child is computer literate.	###and, uh, i was just absolutely shocked, uh, the first time that i saw his schoolwork *t*-1.###uh, i remember *-1 being, you know, taught *-2,###and i think, you know, you have *-1 to teach how * to write an answer *t*-2 and, you know, how * to construct a thought process *t*-3.###speakerb75.###uh-huh.###speakera76.###and, you know, they can get a, they can grasp the points.###can they convey the data verbally or in writing.###and that's what *t*-1's, you know, really scary to me.###uh, i would really, you know,
31337:40	the old social conscience	conscience	says	conscience	and then the, you know, the old social conscience says, you know, i'm not working,	###so, i don't know.###speakerb95.###speakera96.###you know, it does make me nervous.###speakerb97.###well, i can see why if you've got little ones just coming along.###there's a, a whole lot of stuff 0 *t*-1 going on out there.###speakera98.###there is a whole lot of stuff 0 *t*-1 going on out there### and, and part of me says 0 i just would like *-1 to, you know, shut my eyes and pretend 0 it doesn't, you know, go on. or send them to private schools.
31437:46	an individual	individual	has	individual	but, um, in many, many cases whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs, it's not even going *-1 to effect anybody but his, uh, you know, himself and his own family, perhaps, um, depending on the kind of drug 0 he might be on *t*-2.	###on the other hand, um, i think 0 there's certainly some professions that *t*-1 ought *-2 to be tested *-3 because of the, of their responsibility for the public welfare, and certainly people in, uh, industries, well, the transportation industry, for spe-, uh, you know, specifically.###speakera35.###oh, yeah.###speakerb36.###speakera37.###uh-huh.###speakerb38.###speakera39.###oh, yeah.###speakerb40.
31472:27	the drastic step	step	has	step	and i think, personally, 0 the drastic step has *-1 to be that, um, that you can't work if you continue *-2 taking drugs.	###sure.###speakera51.###i mean, you don't know whether the person sitting next to you anywhere is on drugs or not,###speakerb52.###uh-huh.###speakera53.###speakerb54.###uh-huh.###speakera55.###and it takes some drastic steps at this point.
31512:48	this young man's life	life	is	life	but, um, the effect that it's had *t*-1 on this young man's life is so dramatic that it's heartbreaking	###and it's the son and so on,###and he was friends with my children um,###and he's really the only one that i know of *t*-1 personally who *t*-2 got himself really messed *-3 up, um, * ha-, having been involved *-4 with drugs.###but i know of a number of other people who *t*-1 have, you know, gotten all messed *-2 up.###speakera67.###uh-huh.###speakerb68.###most of these are young people.###i work in the education system###and so i have a little more contact with that.
31584:60	everyone	everyone	needs	everyone	personally, i think 0 that's what i was about *-1 to say *t*-2 is that everyone needs *-3 to be tested *-4.	###right.###speakerb94.###because it makes a bigger problem. um,###so it seems to me that, that, um, there needs *-1 to be some ground, you know, some rules that *t*-2 protect.###speakera95.###uh-huh.###speakerb96.###i'm not sure *ich*-4, though, when we talk about what rules, if any *t*-3, that we should say, well, certain segments should not have *-1 to be tested *-2.###i really don't see why,###speakera97.
31605:10	the bottom line	line	is	line	but the bottom line is that, that if, if you're going *-1 to stay clean and straight, then, um, you're, you're going *-2 to do that because you want *-3 to *?*.	###and it *exp*-2 may be, you know, 0 it *exp*-1's not feasible * to do everyone,###but certainly random testing, the fact that people know that, that they,###speakera103.###that it could happen.###speakerb104.###yeah,###speakera105.###uh-huh.###speakerb106.###would be some measure of protection.
31726:6	my sister	sister	tries	sister	my sister tries *-1 to set up a greenhouse on her back deck	###we'll start them inside###and, uh,###speakerb24.###in cold frames or whatever the,###speakera25.###yeah,###well, we usually start them right in the house.###speakerb26.###uh-huh.###speakera27.
31771:11	my brother	brother	lives	brother	well, my brother lives ten miles from here	###so,###speakerb40.###okay,###because that kind of moderates the weather a little bit?###speakera41.###yeah.###speakerb42.###yeah.###speakera43.###we are a little lucky.
31776:10	his crop	crop	gets	crop	and, his crop gets killed *-1.	###yeah.###speakerb42.###yeah.###speakera43.###we are a little lucky.###well, my brother lives ten miles from here###speakerb44.###you're at,###speakera45.###and he gets frost
31848:6	my sister	sister	grows	sister	my sister grows flowers that you can dry *t*-1,	###well, i guess 0 we have *-1 to get back to hobbies since,###speakerb72.###yeah,###we're getting to where, we're straying *t*-3, i guess 0 *t*-1,###speakera73.###stick on the subject.###speakerb74.###yeah.###speakera75.###well, interesting thing that i do *t*-1 is with, gardening, uh,
31858:30	eucalyptus	eucalyptus	is	eucalyptus	yo-, you know what eucalyptus is *t*-1?	###my sister grows flowers that you can dry *t*-1,###speakerb76.###uh-huh.###speakera77.###and you can make fl-, uh, dried flower arrangements###and you can get real handy with the hot glue gun.###and we made some really nice christmas wreaths with, uh, dried red flowers and dried white flowers and, uh, eucalyptus.###speakerb78.###huh, yeah.###speakera79.
32051:6	my sister	sister	does	sister	my sister does, uh, flower gardens.	### it, it just kind of depends on what you're, what you're planting *t*-1,###but, uh all the shrubs and,###speakera139.###yeah,###and, uh, when you have time 0 * to do it *t*-1 *t*-2.###speakerb140.###speakera141.###speakerb142.###yeah.###speakera143.
32066:4	everything	everything	does	everything	everything does real well here in the spring until about, oh, first part of june	###she spends lots of money on them.###and i guess 0 a lot of people do, do do that.###they landscape their whole house with flower gardens.###speakerb146.###yeah.###speakera147.###she's got like, just a small patch of lawn and just flowers and mulch ba-, tree bark all over her lawn.###speakerb148.###yeah.### flowers, during the summer down here, the, the normal kind of flowers, there's very few of them that *t*-1 will really do well.
32110:59	the south	south	is	south	i like the way that, i like the way that idea of the south is *t*-1,	###now where is this *t*-1?###speakera161.###uh, it's in georgia.###speakerb162.###in georgia,###yeah,###yeah.###speakera163.### it's, yeah, it's right outside of macon,### and, and it's just a,

32583:6	my garden	garden	is	garden	my garden is shaped *-1 that i can,	###and i've been watching them every day### and i've, and i haven't seen any signs yet.###so, if i see any signs i'm going *-1 to spray them,###speakera197.###yeah.###speakerb198.###and, uh,###speakera199.###i did something a little bit different *ich*-2 this year that i haven't done *t*-1 before,###i've got,
32628:10	the texas soil	soil	is	soil	but the texas soil isn't the greatest, gardening soil.	###speakera213.###yeah,###speakerb214.###speakera215.###right.###speakerb216.###but, uh, you know, you can improve your own soil there###speakera217.###uh-huh.###speakerb218.
32686:15	the street	street	has	street	my neighbor across the street has one.	###uh-huh.###speakerb240.###speakera241.###uh-huh.###it would be handy.###speakerb242.###and it weighs twenty pounds or, something like that.###speakera243.###yeah.###speakerb244.
32789:15	my wife	wife	does	wife	and, uh, my wife does, uh, a small herb garden on the side.	###and i couldn't find a nursery that *t*-1 had any of them left *-2.###speakerb284.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###speakera285.###but we've got some this year.###speakerb286.###uh, those,###speakera287.###snow peas are up
32853:11	my wife	wife	puts	wife	and then my wife puts them on pizzas. and, and chops them up in recipes and things like that.	###speakerb316.###right.###we froze a lot of peppers.###we let some turn red.###speakera317.###yeah.###uh-huh.###we did that too,###speakerb318.###and some we do *t*-1 *-2 green
33032:21	shrimp fettucini	fettucini	is	fettucini	shrimp, shrimp fettucini is real easy * to, um, make and everything	###speakerb14.###oh, really.###well, i guess 0 * being from that part of the country.###speakera15.###because, i mean, crawfish, everybody over here likes crawfish###but you know, i, i wouldn't have *-1 to worry about *-2 satisfying my guest.###speakerb16.###uh-huh.###speakera17.###but if it was a formal dinner party i would probably think of something else like, uh,
33061:68	their tail	tail	straightens	tail	you can always tell whenever they're cooked *-1 *t*-2 if they've been dead for a long time because their tail straightens out.	###i mean, well, you eat them *-1 dead###speakerb26.###uh-huh.###speakera27.###but,###speakerb28.###* don't buy them *-1 that way.###speakera29.###right.###because if, if they are dead for too long,
33074:12	the tail	tail	is	tail	but if the tail is straight on it then, yeah, * don't eat it.	###speakera31.###and you're not supposed *-1 to eat those because they're bad for you.###speakerb32.###okay.###well, i'll remember that.###speakera33.###yeah,###so if you ever go in a restaurant, * order crawfish,###i mean, every once in a while you'll see on-,###i mean, it doesn't happen very often because it's just an accident
33103:57	everybody	everybody	sucks	everybody	but there's a, there's a, big thing *ich*-1 over here that everybody sucks the head.	###speakerb40.###um-hum.###speakera41.###like if, like my age,###if there was a bunch of college kids coming over for a dinner party, no, i, they would shell their own,###speakerb42.###sure.###speakera43.###you know, we'd just have crawfish and beer or something###but, um, if it was more formal like if i was, you know, working environment then i would probably, um, sh-, shell'em or at least disconnect them from the head.
33148:42	the husband	husband	is	husband	we have a a friend another couple where the husband is the one who *t*-1 cooks all the time *t*-2	###speakera59.###just um the crawfish i mean it just has a taste of its own###it also depends on who *t*-1's cooking it and how much seasoning they use *t*-2 stuff like that###speakerb60.###sure###speakera61.###but um i think that###and also * to get totally off the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party i think that that really helps###speakerb62.###yeah.
33332:11	the sauce	sauce	is	sauce	and then the sauce is just made *-1 with um bouillion cubes water burgundy wine and um cornstarch instead of flour	###speakera159.###that would be wonderful###speakerb160.###* makes them a little bit crunchy###you need *-1 to chop em up *-2 real fine###speakera161.###yeah###speakerb162.###but um it makes them crunchy###and that adds something new to it
33467:4	exercise	exercise	is	exercise	exercise is not supposed *-1 to do that to you.	###speakerb2.###oh, no.###speakera3.###i ripped the ligaments in my right ankle.###speakerb4.###gosh.###speakera5.###yeah###so,###speakerb6.
33512:12	even the spring creek one	one	has	one	even the spring creek one has a lot of weights in it.	###at least since they've redone it, supposedly redone.###so i don't really,###speakera17.###yeah,### it-, well, it's not that great,###and i go to the spring creek one on and off.###but my husband's working over there###and he just goes to the dallas one.###but i just don't,###i mean, it's just so much weight lifting.
33833:8	his name	name	is	name	and his name is b j.	###yeah.###there some things 0 i'd like *-1 to try *t*-2,###but, you know, sometime when i ask *t*-1, i just feel like, boy, am i stupid or what.###speakerb128.###uh-huh.###well that's one thing 0 i like *t*-1 about the spring creek place.###at least the fellow that *t*-2's there, one of the fellows that *t*-1's there at night and on weekends is real helpful.###speakera129.###uh-huh.###speakerb130.
33962:11	the ammunition	ammunition	is	ammunition	uh, the ammunition is probably so old 0 i'm afraid *-1 to use it.	###uh, well what would you say 0 your opinion *ich*-2 is *t*-1 on gun control?###speakerb2.###well, i don't know.### i've, i've had mixed emotions *ich*-4, i guess 0 *t*-3, when i listen to, uh, the radio and, and watch t v *t*-2 about the different, uh, things that *t*-1 are happening.###uh, i'm against it###but on the same token, uh, i went out and purchased a gun just because i wanted the right * to do that.###speakera3.###ye-,###speakerb4.###so i, i have a rifle in the house.
33982:11	my gun	gun	has	gun	uh, my gun hasn't been shot *-1 in a year or two.	###it's a little twenty-two###and i have a twenty-two or a twelve gauge shotgun.###speakerb8.###uh-huh.###speakera9.###an-, you know, i do like *-1 to have my guns.###speakerb10.###speakera11.###uh, i don't know if i'll ever use it, you know.###and like you, my bullets to my little pistol's probably, uh, about three years old.
34042:5	somebody	somebody	wants	somebody	somebody wants *-1 to do that,	###that wasn't too, too bad.###speakera35.###no.###no.###speakerb36.###because if, if you're going *-1 to go *-2 buy something, uh, uh, of that nature, i think 0 you, you're going *-3 to have some idea as to what you're going *-4 to do *t*-5 with it.###you're not going *-1 to react that quickly.###in other words, you know, you don't have a need * to go *-1 buy a gun *-3 to go *-2 shoot it the next day.###speakera37.###th-,
34049:6	a shotgun	shotgun	hurts	shotgun	a shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does.	###in other words, you know, you don't have a need * to go *-1 buy a gun *-3 to go *-2 shoot it the next day.###speakera37.###th-,###somebody wants *-1 to do that,### i, i, at times i think 0 they ought *-1 to have a waiting period on all firearms.###speakerb38.###yeah.###i do too. uh, because it *exp*-2 doesn't make any difference, uh, uh, whether it's a pistol or a shotgun, i suppose 0 *t*-1.###they both do the same kind of job.###speakera39.
34049:22	a pistol	pistol	does	pistol	a shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does.	###in other words, you know, you don't have a need * to go *-1 buy a gun *-3 to go *-2 shoot it the next day.###speakera37.###th-,###somebody wants *-1 to do that,### i, i, at times i think 0 they ought *-1 to have a waiting period on all firearms.###speakerb38.###yeah.###i do too. uh, because it *exp*-2 doesn't make any difference, uh, uh, whether it's a pistol or a shotgun, i suppose 0 *t*-1.###they both do the same kind of job.###speakera39.

37466:44	baseball	baseball	works	baseball	i don't understand the, the strategy of how baseball works *t*-1,	###i mean, uh, i think that, uh, that a player ought *-1 to hit a home run if he's got the pitch 0 * to do it *t*-2,###but when you get two strikes on you *t*-1, you have a tend-, you know, you should, you know, shorten your swing a little bit, you know,###if it's a perfect shot, * go for it,###but i mean, you know, the strike outs were a big problem for him,### and, uh, plus supposedly what i heard *t*-1, he was not much of a team player anyway,###so.###speakerb26.###well it, it's an interesting concept, though, when you look at, uh, of, of how baseball, how apparently,###i was reading in the paper tonight that the detroit tigers are going *-1 to sign him.### and, uh, and the point of, of, i guess,
37492:11	a guy	guy	gets	guy	and finally a guy gets up there and blasts a home run	###it doesn't,### he can, he can stri-, he can swing a couple times, mumblex###if he fouls it up he can swing as much as he can *?*.###speakera31.###right.###speakerb32.###it's an interesting, uh, an interesting concept of, of how they do it *t*-1.###but i agree with you### i think 0 that, i think 0 that's part of what, uh, baseball needs more of *t*-1.### i, uh, i, i guess 0 what *t*-1 bothers me is, is that when you go *t*-2, um, you wait and wait and wait

52511:66	capital punishment	punishment	is	punishment	and i believe that, you know, that i do believe that capital punishment is, uh, alternative.	###really,###i think that,###i don't know,### i don-, i don't think 0 our prison system isn't set *-1 up, where we, um, rehabilitate, or, you know, restore anybody *t*-2.###speakerb14.###speakera15.###i think 0 it'll only make them worse,###but, i, i believe that god can come in and change a person's heart and genuinely change it,###but, that doesn't negate that you do reap what you sow *t*-1.###and if you do kill a person and it is, you know, you're found *-1 to be guilty, i believe 0 *t*-2 god establishes the authority of our court system
52549:10	my concern	concern	is	concern	but, my concern is, first of all that not all, all persons who i think, 0 *t*-1 should be receiving capital, uh, whatever, capital, uh, tha-, uh, th-, uh, hum, punishment,	###it is obvious.###and they know that.### they're, they're not going *-1 to pardon someone from the governor,###you know what i'm saying *t*-1,###they're not going *-1 to go, without *-2 going through every channel of authority in the prison.###so i feel like you know, that's is, there is occasions where there are, they do spare lives *t*-1###and, you know, i leave that with the governor, who, *t*-1 of course, is going *-2 to go through every authority because they want *-3 to be be reelected *-4,###so###speakerb24.###yes
52611:28	god	god	changes	god	but, you know, it's like god changes your heart * to not do that.	###because under the law if your child mo-, back talks you, he would be stoned *-1.###speakerb44.###speakera45.###speakerb46.###that's correct.###speakera47.### he, under the law he would be stoned *-1,###so we've been removed *-1 from the law, of un-, from *-2 being under the law###but we're still, you know, we're still accountable to it.###we don't need *-1 to back talk,
52618:88	this person	person	needs	person	if i don't think see, if i don't believe that there's not a character change and the authorities agree, that this person needs *-1 to be excused *-2, i believe 0 for murder, uh, rape, i even believe *ich*-3 incest, things, that *t*-4 will permanently damage, uh, the character of the child.	###so we've been removed *-1 from the law, of un-, from *-2 being under the law###but we're still, you know, we're still accountable to it.###we don't need *-1 to back talk,###but, you know, it's like god changes your heart * to not do that.###he changes your heart * not to look upon a woman in lust.###because in the old testament, they could look all 0 they wanted *t*-1, just couldn't do it.###but in the new, he's looking at your heart###and so, i guess 0 that's what, what i mean *t*-1 by their character changes###and, you know, what i mean *t*-2, it's like * looking beyond what they're doing *t*-3 and looking at a heart and seeing what is the heart *t*-1, what's the character showing me *t*-4 here.### and, those, and then any of,
52633:27	all the judicial system	system	is	system	plus the, all the judicial system is overloaded with, all kinds of, um, problems, and crimes and so forth and then all of the, um, civil things that *t*-1 clog the courts,	###speakerb50.###i tend *-1 to agree on that, very strongly.###speakera51.###and that's where we just have *-1 to, to trust the authorities *t*-2.###and they're not going *-1 to excuse people, if it was, was run *-2 like that,###i don't,###there would probably be very few exceptions to that###and if it was done *-1 quickly and done *-1 swiftly### and, but it's not, because the judicial system has rejected, they've rejected the answer to all these problems 0 they have *t*-1, pretty much.###speakerb52.
52651:171	capital punishment	punishment	is	punishment	but, but back to the, to the capital situation, * sounds like you and i have a lot of, of, of, uh, common ground at least as, as far as, as capital punishment is concerned *-1.	###speakera57.###uh-huh.###speakerb58.###speakera59.###yeah.###speakerb60.###because we're suit happy.###speakera61.###yeah.###speakerb62.

52707:30	the answer	answer	is	answer	because, there's no, the answer is not being given *-1 to them, in the court system	###i forget what you call it *t*-1,###but anyway, and everyone, they had like fifteen people lined *-1 up on the fence###and within two hours, there were fifteen boys sitting there doing the same thing.###speakerb76.###um.###speakera77.###and, you'd see the same kid who *t*-1 were back out there in two days.###speakerb78.###that's sad.###speakera79.

58269:14	even britain	britain	has	britain	i mean even britain has converted over	###speakerb24.###oh, yeah.###speakera25.###and as long as both were given *-1, you, basically, just don't read the kilometers per hour,###you just say, well look * read the miles per hour one,###the other one must be for someone else.###speakerb26.###that's right.###speakera27.###uh, i don't know,
58286:6	america	america	does	america	and america does have a long history of * sort of doing things our own way rather than adopting, you know, some other model.	###well, i mean, it's more *ich*-1 our fault than theirs at this point because they, they saw the light, um,###i don't know why they we-, um, were more able than we were *?* *t*-1###except i think, that they probably just said well, we're just going *-1 to start *-2 using the things now###and you sort of have *-1 to force people to change since they don't want *-2 to.###speakerb30.###of course, * being part of the european community, if everybody else did it they, they were probably much more,###* is much more necessary for them than for us.###speakera31.###that's true,### that's, that's probably true
58295:18	my feeling	feeling	is	feeling	i guess, 0 my feeling is 0 the way 0 * to do it *t*-1 is, is * to just start *-2 giving weights, you know, have a very brief transition period and then just start *-3 giving weights and kilometers, er, just as in kilometers and weights and kilograms and everything like that and, uh, just have people start *-4 using it rather than having people constantly trying *-5 to convert.	### that's, that's probably true###and america does have a long history of * sort of doing things our own way rather than adopting, you know, some other model.###speakerb32.###there's an expression for that,###with eyes on the past, * backing confidently into the future.###speakera33.###i've never heard that one,###that's very nice.###oh, so i'm all for the metric system and * converting over###and i think,
58362:20	the real trick	trick	is	trick	and i think 0 the real trick is * to avoid the you know,	###yeah.###speakera51.### and, you know. but that must have been tremendously difficult 0 * to orchestrate *t*-1.###speakerb52.###yeah.###speakera53.###speakerb54.###i'm sure.###speakera55.###um, so i, i, i, i, i think 0 it *exp*-1's essential that it's done
58387:165	the metric	metric	is	metric	and if you start *-1 expressing one liters and one kilograms and then the pounds come in the, the, you know, the odd numbers, you know, two point two pounds or something. i think 0 people will start *-2 getting a sense of, gee the metric is the sensible one.	###uh-huh,###i saw that,###i saw that the other day.###i don-, don't drink soda pop,###speakerb60.###yeah.###speakera61.###but i saw a two liter soda pop bottle###so, yeah,###things like that are a good start

59222:20	anybody	anybody	tells	anybody	i don't care what anybody tells you *t*-1.	###but i was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that *t*-1 married during my time, they had kids within a year.###speakerb94.###yeah.###speakera95.###and i just was not ready for kids.###i wanted *-1 to get out and work a little bit###and i wanted *-1 to travel and stuff like that, which we did *t*-2.###and, uh, kids didn't fit in right then,###but, it's getting more and more like that where there's more and more couples *t*-1###and, really, if you don't want the kids, then it's not the time 0 * to have,

62447:6	my husband	husband	goes	husband	my husband goes *-1 to pick it up last week	###speakerb54.###okay.###so they did that.###and we said are you sure 0 this will work,###we don't want you to go through the work and then find out that this doesn't really work anyway, and et cetera,###and they're, they were doing it at their own costs.### and so we said, fine.###and we went back###and we talked to the mumblex person a second time and things like that,###and then we come, we get the computer home,
62477:25	much time	time	goes	time	and, and so much time goes past before you finally get any kind of satisfaction.	###and they say 0 they can, you know, do something different and change some connectors###and we hope so,###but it's a hassle.###speakera63.###yeah,###it really is *?*.###speakerb64.### you kn-, you know, 0 it's just this problem with sales people just not knowing what *t*-1 goes on.###speakera65.###right,
62563:36	the little thing	thing	pokes	thing	and she says 0 it's wrong too because the little thing pokes out too far,	###and the next thing 0 i knew *t*-1 the tape was chewed *-2 up in the, thing.###speakerb98.###oh, no.###speakera99.###okay,###so after that then you couldn't get a, you couldn't get a tape 0 * to play *t*-1 at the right speed in that side.###speakerb100.###uh-huh.###speakera101.###and then on the other side, when i, when i, uh, i loa-, loaned it to my daughter the other day * to take it over to, uh, to, uh, videotaping 0 they were doing *t*-1 *t*-2,

62684:28	the problem	problem	comes	problem	well, i think 0 part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship.	###speakerb144.###speakera145.###so, part of it is that we need *-1 to develop more of a, of a pride in, in, uh, the kinds of things 0 we do *t*-2 so we make them better.###speakerb146.###good.###yeah.###speakera147.###and it kind of has *-1 to start from the top and, and go clea-, or from the bottom maybe and go clear up.###people,###speakerb148.
62693:6	nobody	nobody	cares	nobody	nobody cares, no, nobody's, really paying,	###speakerb148.###well, i think 0 part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship.###the people just don't care about, what they're doing *t*-1.###speakera149.###no.###speakerb150.###speakera151.###yeah.###speakerb152.###you know, the whole,

63038:8	my dragginess	dragginess	is	dragginess	but my dragginess is my excuse for * not exercising.	###and i just feel much better.###i mean, i've been kind of dragging the last few weeks,###and i know 0 if i would just get around to exercising i'd feel better.###speakerb84.###exactly###speakera85.###speakerb86.###it does,###it gives you energy.###speakera87.

63176:53	the weather	weather	gets	weather	they even have some, uh, aerobic, uh, water aerobics when the weather gets nice *t*-1 out in the pool.	###speakerb130.###oh, yeah.###speakera131.###but there's a lot more guys that *t*-1 do that one.###speakerb132.###uh-huh.###speakera133.###and, um, they have them, you know, in the evenings,###they even have some late night ones for people that *t*-1 work second shift and things like that.###so they have big variety.
63331:9	this country	country	is	country	course this country isn't a dictatorship,	###speakera29.### the, uh, i think 0 maybe there's where the problem came in *t*-1, you know.###we've tried *-1 to, instead of *-2 learning,###it's kind of like * learning a language, you know,###when you learn one from the other *t*-1, you always end up in this conversion thing all the time.###speakerb30.###yeah.###speakera31.###so, you,###it's almost like, uh,
63337:9	thing	thing	is	thing	well, thing is, 0 it's a global, global market place these days,	###yeah.###speakera31.###so, you,###it's almost like, uh,###course this country isn't a dictatorship,###but, you know, it's like somebody said, okay as of such and such a date, you know, anybody caught * talking in the english, you know, will be shot *-1 or something like that, you know.###speakerb32.###speakera33.###but, uh,###speakerb34.
63428:6	temperature	temperature	is	temperature	and temperature is the big thing the centigrade for which she says celsius *t*-1.	###you know, i guess 0 that's some###speakerb66.###about half a liter.###speakera67.###it's not a liter,###it's like a half a liter or something like that.###it's a strange looking can.###but my daughter in law's from panama,###and she has, they have had americans down there for so long, you know, that they're kind of into both systems,###but, uh, she gets real confused on distances
63445:31	the big problem	problem	is	problem	so, but, uh. the big problem is not * having the, uh, the resolution between temperature, you know, between a hundred, if you're talking about a hundred degrees or what, thirty, zero, you know thirty four degrees, whatever that is *t*-1.	###speakerb72.###speakera73.###well, i had kind of gotten used to centigrade temperature, you know,###if it's between zero and ten, it's cold,###and if it's ten and twenty it's not too bad,###if it's between twenty and thirty it's pretty warm,###speakerb74.###it's getting warm, right.###speakera75.###if it's more than thirty it's just hotter than all get out.
63513:18	the thing	thing	is	thing	matter of fact, the thing is, 0 i always say 0 it's built *-1 off shore, you know, because it was assembled *-2 in canada.	###he just get one more mumblex.###speakera93.###because i think 0 the wentworth *rnr*-1 and the s a e *rnr*-1 bolt sizes were the same,###but the threads were different,###and, uh it was a total mess.###speakerb94.###oh, that would be a mess.###speakera95.###and on my chevy van that *t*-1's a couple of years old.###part of it's built *-1 in canada.
63542:13	the sign	sign	looks	sign	hundreds on the sign looks lot better than fifty five,	###i thought 0 maybe they would convert to, uh, metric back when they went to the fifty-five mile an hour speed limit *t*-1, because what is it *t*-2 fifty-six or fifty-seven's a hundred, uh, qua-, a hundred kilometers,###speakerb100.###yeah.###speakera101.###and you know###speakerb102.###hell, you'd have people doing a hundred miles an hour.###speakera103.###yeah,###you'd have,
63561:17	all the road signs	road	signs	road	well they converted all the road signs to fifty-five miles an hour, you know,	###that'd sure seems like a long way.###speakerb106.###yeah,###but they'd need, they'd seem *-1 to be ticking off faster, too.###speakera107.###yeah,###i guess 0 that's it.###speakerb108.###every road sign 0 you come to *t*-1, is like, well i don't know 0 it that far.###speakera109.
63582:61	the old canal zone	zone	is	zone	and you got *-1 to know where you are *t*-2 because anything that *t*-3 was the old canal zone is going *-4 to be miles per hour,	###at that time, anyway, that was still when things were,###the metric system was still not,###speakera113.###not all that common.###speakerb114.###you know, now cars, they have both.###sooner or later they'll start *-1 putting the miles on the inside and the kilometers in big numbers so people start *-2 thinking that way.###speakera115.###i know 0 the only other place that i was ever at *t*-1 where they really had it mixed *t*-2 was, was in panama, where's a lot of the road signs and everything are in, in miles per hour *t*-3###and some are in kilometers.
63732:23	our garbage	garbage	is	garbage	but i didn't realize that our garbage isn't being decomposed *-1.	###that was surprising to me.###speakera53.###um.###speakerb54.###i missed that question, totally, i mean really bad.###i'm trying *-1 to think,###i didn't miss too many,###i can't remember what my score was *t*-1,###but i did exceeding well.###i was surprised.
63766:8	the cost	cost	is	cost	but the cost is kind of prohibitive.	###true.###yeah,###i noticed that about things like### i s-, i seen a lot of adds *ich*-1 recently for organic fertilizers and, and lawn additives and that type of thing,###but the cost is, is like, double or sometimes triple, what the regular things 0 you, fertilizers and things 0 you buy *t*-1.###speakerb62.###uh-huh.###speakera63.###so, in, in terms of that, it's,###you know, and, for the environment it's, it's, there's a good reason 0 * to do it *t*-1,
63811:44	the weather	weather	changes	weather	and, they don't expand or, or contract when the weather changes *t*-1,	### i, i'd heard something stranger,###* talk about bottles the other day on, uh, on the radio station, i think 0 it's k l t y. they were talking about the,###i think 0 it's in canada 0 they're using, oh, recyclable milk jugs, plastic milk jugs, as a, a reinforcement for roads. for road repairs *t*-1.###speakerb78.###uh-huh.###speakera79.###speakerb80.###oh, really?###speakera81.###and apparently they, they don't break down very easily,

65806:75	college	college	is	college	but there's a lot of people that *t*-1 don't want their higher education as far as quote, quote college is concerned *-2.	###but see, that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with the people. at people, per, at high school level, which i would like *-1 to see *t*-2. rather than so many kids getting out of school.###speakera49.###uh-huh.###speakerb50.### they're, they go on the unemployment list before we have turn around. because they don't have any education.###speakera51.###uh-huh.###speakerb52.###i don't mean college.###and i'm for college.
65997:42	even that little bit	bit	helps	bit	just i fe-, i feel like even that little bit helps.	###i mean, it's, it *exp*-2's tempting when you see something *t*-1 * to say," well, i'll just charge it."###and sometimes i'll do that,###but usually i, i will try *-1 to pay everything off the next month###or the ones that *t*-1 usually have an outstanding balance all the time, i'll, i'll pay more than the minimum payment.###speakera52.###uh-huh.###speakerb53.###speakera54.###uh-huh.###speakerb55.

67902:34	somebody	somebody	is	somebody	* to, uh, to kill somebody is what it amounts to *t*-2.	### i, uh, i agree with you there.###uh, uh-huh.###speakera39.###i think 0 i'd probably do it###but we could never say what we would do *t*-1 if we're not in the circumstance.### it, that's, that's, that's a real easy thing * to say that, oh, sure i would *?*,###but i don't know.###speakerb40.###well, i myself wouldn't want *-1 to be on the jury like that.###uh, i, it, it's, uh, that's an awful lot 0 * to, uh, to expect *t*-1 of a person,
67937:113	a death, uh, or, uh, yeah, death verdict	verdict	is	verdict	well now any, uh, just * believe 0 in just about any state in the union, uh, uh, a death, uh, or, uh, yeah, death verdict is an automatic, uh, appeal.	###speakera51.###yeah,###i agree 0 it should be in effect.###also i agree 0 there should be a lot of care in the enforcement, uh,###so i guess 0 i would say 0 i want it to be in effect###but i want, maybe###well, i'd, i, now i have a problem with this, too.###i think 0 our courts have too many opportunities for them to go back and get one more chance.###speakerb52.###oh, that's true.
68062:32	time	time	goes	time	and it seems *-1 to be getting tougher as time goes by.	###now, my, my, my wife, my ex-wife, she quit, uh, well, when she was pregnant with the last one *t*-1###and she never started up again.###and i just quit, oh, about fourteen months and two weeks ago.###speakera91.###boy,###that's tough.###speakerb92.###yes,###it is *?*.###i,

68289:60	everyone	everyone	agrees	everyone	i thought 0 that was the point of, uh, a unanimous jury was the idea that if everyone agrees then there shouldn't be any reasonable doubt.	###i think 0 it should be by a jury.###i don't think 0 the judge should have##, i mean he's just there kind of like the referee.###speakera5.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakerb6.###uh, i don't, i don't even think that it should be unanimous either. uh,###speakera7.###well, what about the idea that one is only guilty, uh, when *-1 proven *-2 guilty beyond a reasonable doubt *t*-3?

68406:6	the problem	problem	is	problem	the problem is 0 i can't guarantee that a judge would be necessarily be much better than a jury,	###and they say that, uh, juries are extremely vulnerable to, uh, sort of emotional pitches, you know,###the prosecutor will want *-1 to, oh, i don't know show the, show the mugging victim, you know, show what the nice person 0 he was *t*-2 and what a family life, and basically get the jury to be very sympathetic with the victim,### and, uh, or, or, uh, if it's a corporation, that *t*-1 was, uh, you know, har-, harming some individual or something like that, they get very much, well, you know, it's just a big faceless corp-, corporation.###* let's, let's make them pay as much as possible.###things like that.###speakerb42.###uh-huh.###speakera43.###so, not,### i, i mean, i'm,
68424:21	the judge's time	time	is	time	i guess 0 the judge's time is worth too much, though.	###yeah.###speakerb48.###least with the jury you have twelve people, you know that *t*-1 are going *-2 to decide, you know,###speakera49.###uh-huh.###speakerb50.###you're the, the person's fate.###speakera51.###well, how about * having a j-, jury and a judge work together on it somehow?###i wonder if that's possible?

70030:4	nothing	nothing	seems	nothing	nothing seems quite as good.	###and i guess 0 i'm going *-1 to have *-2 to try that area sometime and see what it's like *t*-3.###because a lot of people that *t*-1 are from that north carolina region really like it.###and, uh, they get the snow,###but they said 0 it doesn't really get messy###and it doesn't really hang around that long.###speakera137.###yeah.###speakerb138.###so, they, the people 0 i know *t*-1 that *t*-2 are from there, uh, they always miss it###and they want *-1 to go back.

82779:160	their voice	voice	is	voice	but i do not think 0 it is difficult enough * to prevent people who *t*-1 are motivated in the first place, who, or, who *t*-2 are not just motivated who *t*-3 really believe that their, they, their voice is heard *-4.	###speakera47.###people are always mo-, you know,###one out of every seven people moves every year.###uh, th-, that is almost a fourteen percent turnover every, you know,###speakerb48.###uh-huh.###speakera49.###if you compound that, that, uh, eh- eh, th-,### i-, if it *exp*-2 is difficult * to register *-1 to vote, that would remove your eligibility * to vote.###speakerb50.

82912:77	a, candidate	candidate	promises	candidate	and, eh, and, eh, y-, no matter what a, a, candidate promises *t*-2 during the campaign, i-, which *t*-1 isn't very much, specif-,	###speakerb100.### i don't, i don't care how easy *ich*-2 it is *t*-1 for them,###i do not think 0 they are going *-1 to *?* because they do no think that their, that anybody listens to their vote.###they think 0 whoever *t*-1 has the b-.###they really think that the packs, you know, no matter what you're promised *-2 *t*-1 during a campaign,###and these days we are promised *-1 hardly anything of substance.###speakera101.###oh, you mean the special interest groups?###speakerb102.###right.

82986:69	their vote	vote	does	vote	but, simply because people were so concerned about their inability that to, that their vote does not count any way.	###speakera123.###i think that we just discovered in this, in, in the indian elections is th-, one of the greatest greatest and massive things in, in the world.###speakerb124.###oh.###speakera125.###uh, just, it was, got vi-, more violent every year.###speakerb126.###right.###speakera127.###they went down almost fifty percent in this election before they blew up ghandi.
82999:45	everything	everything	is	everything	but th-, but, you know, everything is relative to when, uh, eh, w-w-, you know, we had higher turnouts *t*-1 because at that time we cur-, talk about the turnout relative to the eligible voter, right?	###oh, really?###speakera129.###speakerb130.###speakera131.###speakerb132.###yeah.###speakera133.###speakerb134.###huh.###speakera135.
83011:7	everybody	everybody	is	everybody	now everybody is available.	###yeah.###speakera137.###i mean is,### but, but before these enormous, before this voting rights act, what we had *t*-1 was a, a great deal of our population, uh, mainly the blacks in the south and the hispanics were precluded *-2 by, by, uh, voting laws, uh, from * reg-, from their eligibility * to register.###speakerb138.###uh-huh.###speakera139.###speakerb140.###oh.###speakera141.
83075:32	the time	time	is	time	but usually by this time they tell me that the time is up.	###well, with the minorities###and we are saying 0 we have lower voter turnout.###maybe it is, is, uh, 0 now that we have minorities included *-1 in the...###speakera161.###you know, karen, i wonder if we are recording.###speakerb162.###why,###did you not press one?###speakera163.###i did press one,

83132:96	the prisoner	prisoner	is	prisoner	and the eighteen years will, uh, translate into something like, uh, four point seven, if every, if the, if the prisoner is a model prisoner,	###they are saying, oh, well, you know, the, the people can not afford it.###speakera21.###speakerb22.###speakera23.### i do not, i don't know how it is *t*-1 in virginia,###speakerb24.###speakera25.###speakerb26.###speakera27.###but in florida now, uh, uh, uh, at eighteen years, someone was just sentenced *-1 to eighteen years, i heard it on today, uh, without any specific recommendation for, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, * waving the normal, uh, procedures.
83241:31	crime	crime	outweighs	crime	the benefit, i guess 0 *t*-2, of crime outweighs what the deterrent is *t*-1.	###i know,###it, uh, does seem like the, the, the, the purpose of * getting people in jail so that, you know, the, the,###i can not think of the word 0 i am looking for *t*-1.###anyway, the deterrent. for people to, to commit the cri-, uh, to not to commit the crime is sort of gone away.###speakera67.###yes.###speakerb68.###people have,###i do not know,###they just do not care any more.
83241:44	the deterrent	deterrent	is	deterrent	the benefit, i guess 0 *t*-2, of crime outweighs what the deterrent is *t*-1.	###i know,###it, uh, does seem like the, the, the, the purpose of * getting people in jail so that, you know, the, the,###i can not think of the word 0 i am looking for *t*-1.###anyway, the deterrent. for people to, to commit the cri-, uh, to not to commit the crime is sort of gone away.###speakera67.###yes.###speakerb68.###people have,###i do not know,###they just do not care any more.

90327:8	their attitude	attitude	is	attitude	and their attitude is," i'm a bad boy,"	###speakerb83.###uh-huh.###speakera84.### and, and we get it even at our level in, in,###i work a nine ten school,###and we get students that *t*-1 come in that *t*-2 have been kicked *-3 out of the, uh, parochial and pub-, and, uh, private schools###speakerb85.###uh-huh.###speakera86.###and, uh, they come in
90388:74	their child	child	has	child	the, in fact, they've had cases *ich*-1 in the past where parents have committed suicide because their child has not gotten into the top kindergarten, which *t*-2 means 0 they probably won't get into the top elementary and, and high school *t*-3,	###speakerb107.###you're right.###speakera108.###and i have a problem when they compare the kids in japan or germany to the kids here *t*-1.### in, in, in, uh, ho-, honesty, the kids in japan are, they have *-1 to try out *-3 to even get into, to which kindergarten they're going *-2 to get into *t*-4,###speakerb109.###oh, really?###speakera110.###and then after, uh,###and if, if you only,
90407:8	the other thing	thing	is	thing	the other thing is that the priority in the family is that child's education, and is that child.	###it's only their top ones that *t*-1 go on, like ours do.###speakerb115.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera116.### and, and, uh, so that, that creates a problem.### and, and you can't compare, because they go so many more hours.###speakerb117.###yeah.###speakera118.
90407:29	the family	family	is	family	the other thing is that the priority in the family is that child's education, and is that child.	###it's only their top ones that *t*-1 go on, like ours do.###speakerb115.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera116.### and, and, uh, so that, that creates a problem.### and, and you can't compare, because they go so many more hours.###speakerb117.###yeah.###speakera118.
90424:6	the child	child	is	child	the child is very bright,	###that's right.###speakerb123.###um, i, i was talking to somebody recently or read somewhere where they, where they said that, you know, these children, they, they had *-2 to be the best *t*-1,###and they put off all social life, all everything, you know.###speakera124.###that's right,###that's right.###speakerb125.###well, is that good?###yes,
90440:34	their childhood	childhood	is	childhood	and so that's why i said, 0 their childhood is extremely different from mine *t*-1.	###yes.###speakerb129.###sure,###sure,###i think 0 it *exp*-1's real important * to have friends.###i think 0 it *exp*-1's real important * to play sports.###i think 0 it *exp*-1's real important * to be part of a team.###speakera130.###right.###speakerb131.
90574:8	the only problem	problem	is	problem	the only problem is that now, uh,	###yeah.###speakera34.###i mean, either way there was family reunion time, or not,###speakerb35.###right,### i, i usually see her a, couple times a year###speakera36.###speakerb37.###so that's no, no big thing.###but, uh, i, uh, i do, i do enjoy the reunions.
90651:47	society	society	is	society	it's just the way, you know, 0 i think 0 society is *t*-1 now, is that we are not, we do not have the extensive family 0 we used *-2 to *?* *t*-3.	###speakerb61.###well, yeah.###speakera62.###speakerb63.###yeah,###that's, uh,###yeah,###i think 0 that's some of it.###but, you know, i have,###uh, i, i,
90762:8	the sister	sister	is	sister	and the sister is in a nursing home,	###i sent it, on to the next one,###speakerb99.###yeah.###speakera100.### and, and, but we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one, in scottsdale, arizona, for that family.###speakerb101.###uh-huh.###speakera102.###we are real glad 0 we got together because since that, that time there were only like two of the, one sister and one sister-in-law of the original family left *.###and the sister-in-law died
90794:15	expertise	expertise	is	expertise	but my area of expertise is, uh, uh, human computer interaction.	###uh-huh.###speakerb10.###so,###speakera11.### that, that's similar to what,###i'm in a p h d program right now.###speakerb12.###oh, i see.###speakera13.###and, uh, my area of expertise, it's information systems, which *t*-1 is a little bit less technical, i think, than, uh, than computer science.
90811:21	the thing	thing	is	thing	well, you know, the thing is, 0 when you're a kid *t*-2	###speakera17.###yeah.### so, so, good luck.###i guess 0 we should talk about * giving advice, though.### wh-, what, what type of advice do you think 0 you'd give *t*-1 to a, a parent?###speakerb18.###to a parent?###speakera19.###yeah.###speakerb20.
90841:12	the kid	kid	does	kid	so if the kid does change, they don't have *-1 to transfer,	###speakera29.### i kn-, i know very few people that, uh, *t*-1 started in one field and stayed with it.###you know, they,###i think 0 that's what you just said *t*-1, you know, * having * to do more with the size of the school, the environment of the school, uh,###i think 0 that's much more important.### i, i think 0 i'd, i'd advise a parent *-1 to send a kid to a school *ich*-2, though, that *t*-3 has a number of different types of programs, you know, that, uh, some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer *t*-1,###but some of the, uh, the small, some of the larger small schools, you know, i guess 0 around three or four thousand students have a, can offer a broader range of curriculums and things,###speakerb30.###yeah.###speakera31.
90856:55	the kid	kid	does	kid	because, um one of the reasons is because, you know, the kid doesn't know exactly what they want *t*-1,	###yeah.###that's disruptive.###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###speakera35.###i normally,### and, and parents hate *-1 to hear this, you know,###because i, i actually teach college,### i hate *-1 to, uh, i hate *-2 to talk to the parents
90914:54	the kid	kid	does	kid	and i don't, i think 0 because it costs less, the kid doesn't take it quite as serious, you know,	###speakera55.###i teach at a public school, actually,###and i know that the s a t scores for our admitting freshmen are higher than a lot of the public sch-, a lot of the private schools.###and, um, i actually, i would full time at a, at a public school,###and then right now i'm teaching part time at a private school, at a catholic institution.###speakerb56.###oh, i see.###speakera57.### and, um, and i really think, i think 0 i'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school, because i think 0 their parents pay more,###and i think 0 the kids are a little bit more challenged, because their parents are probably college educated, where at the public school, i don't think 0 as many parents are public, are, are college educated,
90924:33	the bad part	part	is	part	i, i think 0 the bad part is that most parents or kids don't know what * to look for *t*-1.	###and i don't, i think 0 because it costs less, the kid doesn't take it quite as serious, you know,### they're not, th-,### it, it's the minimal cost.###but i think 0 you can get a good education at public or private###but i think 0 you can also get a bad education at public or private, you know,###i###speakerb58.###yeah.###speakera59.### you have *-1 to really, you have *-2 to look around at the school.
91029:97	today	today	is	today	i, i guess 0 another thing that *t*-1 concerns me is, uh, 0 so many people, it seems like everybody today is still in that mumblex job market	###speakera93.###so i think yeah,###that's important,###um,. i think 0 it depends on if you want *-1 to be a, if you want a regional job or a national job,###you need that first, job or so out of school, too.###speakerb94.###yeah.###speakera95.###speakerb96.###yeah.
91352:8	the first issue	issue	does	issue	the first issue doesn't come out until next year,	###oh, that's what i do *t*-1 too.###speakera113.###yeah,###and that's about it, because otherwise i'm reading so much for school.### i'm, um, i have just started *-1 reading a book.###actually, it's for school,###but it's for, um,###there's a, a literary jour-,###well, not a literary journal,### it's a, it's kind of a journal of, of the history of ideas that *t*-1's, that *t*-2's starting *-3 to be published *-4, um, from u t d.

97633:57	the woman	woman	has	woman	uh, i think 0 it's, it's the image that the woman has *t*-1 and, uh, in the world, as, uh, the lesser of the two.	###speakerb52.###so, basically that's, that's,###well i am done *-1 talking.###do you want *-1 to talk?.###speakera53.###well, i think that you carried forth your subject matter very well, uh, nickie.###and i can, uh, relate to that, uh,###speakerb54.###uh-huh.###speakera55.
97641:8	the changing	changing	is	changing	but the changing is taking a long time longer than we would like it to, like it to take.	###uh-huh.###speakera55.###uh, i think 0 it's, it's the image that the woman has *t*-1 and, uh, in the world, as, uh, the lesser of the two.###speakerb56.###uh-huh.###speakera57.###speakerb58.###oh, always.###speakera59.###and, uh, i think 0 things are changing,
97653:19	the main point	point	is	point	so, that's the main point is that we are going ahead.	###uh-huh.###speakera61.###and, uh, i think 0 we are progressing at a snail's pace,###speakerb62.###indeed.###speakera63.###but we are progressing.###speakerb64.###uh-huh.###speakera65.
97754:45	somebody	somebody	is	somebody	even if they want *-1 to *?*, they are more comfortable when somebody is the boss *t*-2.	###but, when he gets angry *t*-1, it's always over control issues,###it's always over power issues,###it's never over, you know,###it's always, you said 0 you were going *-2 to do something and you did not do it. as if he is the boss and i am the, you know, and i am the slave.###speakera109.###uh-huh.###speakerb110.###and it,###those are the only, only issues 0 we ever fight about *t*-1.### i think 0 it's just, i think 0 it *exp*-1's just difficult for men * to, uh, to accept women equally,
97769:83	the subject matter	matter	is	matter	and, uh, but i think that they should be in harmony with what they are *t*-1, with what the subject matter is *t*-2.	###um.###speakera113.###and, uh, the women when they are married *-1 *t*-2, they are *-3 to be subjective to their husbands.###speakerb114.###um.###speakera115.###and i believe that strongly.###speakerb116.###um.###speakera117.
97983:10	the five year old	old	does	old	the five year old doesn't have the attention span, either.	###speakerb60.###right.###speakera61.### the, uh, the oldest is nine,###the youngest is three.###he doesn't really pay attention.###speakerb62.###yeah,###yeah.###speakera63.
98194:8	our neighborhood	neighborhood	is	neighborhood	and our neighborhood is pretty much working class people, though i'm in graduate school, uh,	###speakerb7.###uh-huh.###speakera8.###and there are parts of town here where, when they talk about the nightly gunfire *t*-1.###speakerb9.###oh, yeah.###yeah,###in baltimore we have similar.###uh, i live on the outskirts of baltimore###and, uh, we live right outside the city
98222:24	my end	end	is	end	the sort of on my end is *t*-1 more of the upper middle class	### that, uh, the, what they call *t*-1 the latchkey children.###speakerb17.###yeah,###something like that.###no one's, you know,### or, or fathers are just missing, you know,###so there's no, uh, no consistency there in the home or whatever.###there's no one *-1 to tell them what *t*-2's right and what *t*-3's wrong, you know.###speakera18.###yeah.
98259:11	the thing	thing	is	thing	well, the thing is, 0 i don't,	###yeah,###i think 0 that's, we're about the same in baltimore.###though, uh, washington, i think is, uh, close by###and, you know, they experience a lot more.###speakera32.###uh-huh.###speakerb33.###i think 0 they definitely have more problems that, uh, in, in the area.### what, what do you think 0 *t*-1 can prevent crime?###speakera34.
98273:57	the problem	problem	is	problem	it's, it's basically the, the problem is within the, in the society and the society's views	###speakera36.###unfortunately there are often these correlations that *t*-1 are inverse of what they should be *t*-2 like, uh, wherever there are more, uh, criminals *t*-3, there are more policemen###speakerb37.###yeah.###speakera38.###but that's which *t*-1 came first.###speakerb39.###yeah.###speakera40.###but, on the other side of it is
98305:40	baltimore	baltimore	is	baltimore	our, uh, our mayor in, uh, baltimore is one of the people that *t*-1 goes on national television and says 0 they should, uh, legalize drugs. because it would eliminate the, uh, the violence and the, uh, the under-, the, the market, i guess 0 *t*-3, the, the hidden market of the drugs and everything that *t*-2 goes along with it.	###speakerb53.###uh-huh.###speakera54.###but i think, you know, that there is a lot in the society where things have changed *t*-1,###uh, so it's effected all of us.###speakerb55.###uh-huh.###yeah,###i think 0 they, the drug culture definitely has, uh, is one of the main problems.###yeah,
98335:13	the other side	side	is	side	well, the other side is that unfortunately some of the down side,	###because it comes a bit from the angle that the, uh, uh,###it would certainly be an interesting test###speakerb63.###uh-huh.###speakera64.###but the other side of it, to me,###speakerb65.###what *t*-1 happens if we lose worse.###speakera66.###uh, y-,
98340:8	the thing	thing	is	thing	but the thing is, 0 if somebody ruined their life, uh, society didn't try *-1 to then save themselves from it,	###but the other side of it, to me,###speakerb65.###what *t*-1 happens if we lose worse.###speakera66.###uh, y-,###well, the other side is that unfortunately some of the down side,###and i think 0 if i look back fifty or a hundred years i'd say 0, you know, back then there were the opium dens###speakerb67.###right.###speakera68.
98381:4	crime	crime	is	crime	crime is one of those things that *t*-1's, uh,	###speakera82.###speakerb83.###but i never, i never heard results or anything like that,###so i never, you know,###plus, that's such a, that's not a true, uh, you know, it really couldn't be a good test because alaska's so different than every other part of the country.###speakera84.###uh-huh.###speakerb85.###you know, so that, but that was interesting, you know,### i, i don't,
98424:45	the crime	crime	is	crime	but, you know, the other thing that *t*-1 bothers me in the crime is the, uh,	###speakerb95.###uh-huh.###speakera96.###and i see, 0 unfortunately, we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and, you know, there's a million dollars 0 you can have *t*-1 uh, for mental duress or whatever *t*-2 *t*-3.###speakerb97.###uh-huh.###speakera98.###speakerb99.###yeah.###speakera100.
98426:8	drunk driving	driving	is	driving	and drunk driving is a good one,	###speakera96.###and i see, 0 unfortunately, we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and, you know, there's a million dollars 0 you can have *t*-1 uh, for mental duress or whatever *t*-2 *t*-3.###speakerb97.###uh-huh.###speakera98.###speakerb99.###yeah.###speakera100.###but, you know, the other thing that *t*-1 bothers me in the crime is the, uh,###in europe, they seem *-1 to have mentality,
98427:43	drunken driving	driving	is	driving	* is that people are well indoctrinated *-1 in their society that drunken driving is unacceptable.	###and i see, 0 unfortunately, we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and, you know, there's a million dollars 0 you can have *t*-1 uh, for mental duress or whatever *t*-2 *t*-3.###speakerb97.###uh-huh.###speakera98.###speakerb99.###yeah.###speakera100.###but, you know, the other thing that *t*-1 bothers me in the crime is the, uh,###in europe, they seem *-1 to have mentality,###and drunk driving is a good one,
98436:165	the punishment	punishment	is	punishment	in this country, and for example with alcohol or with drugs is, we don't seem *-1 to understand how * to handle it as a society to say okay, it is okay under these circumstances, but if you step outside these bounds, the punishment is extreme *t*-2.	###and drunk driving is a good one,###* is that people are well indoctrinated *-1 in their society that drunken driving is unacceptable.###speakerb101.###right.###speakera102.###and, yeah,###if you're going *-1 to drink, and you may drink, you better have your designated driver.###speakerb103.###uh-huh.###speakera104.
98443:40	the drunk driving	driving	has	driving	that, i think that, uh, the drunk driving has just actually, just caught on.	###speakerb103.###uh-huh.###speakera104.###in this country, and for example with alcohol or with drugs is, we don't seem *-1 to understand how * to handle it as a society to say okay, it is okay under these circumstances, but if you step outside these bounds, the punishment is extreme *t*-2.###and we mean it.###speakerb105.###yeah.###speakera106.###speakerb107.###yeah.
98505:12	maryland	maryland	is	maryland	well, see maryland is one of the most,	###yeah,###very much so.###yeah,### that, those are some important points.###yeah,###i,### that's, those are,###speakera132.### what are, what does your city have *t*-1 for gun control if anything?###speakerb133.
98534:38	some expertise	expertise	is	expertise	and one thing that you get *t*-2 if you have some expertise is, uh, you know the range of, of possible values or terms or, you know, how heinous was the crime *t*-1.	###or even a panel of, of lawyers if, if it got to that point. might be better at than just regular civil people. not knowing, you know, exactly what things are *t*-1, from, from murder on up to like tax stuff, you know.###speakera6.###uh-huh.###speakerb7.###speakera8.###yeah.###because i find that, uh,###i've been on a few juries###and, uh, as a say, i, i tend *-1 to be around, uh, civil cases because i've been an expert witness some,###and, uh, many matters are so complicated that it *exp*-1's so hard * to, uh, come up with the fair value, uh, or the fair sentence
98591:36	an individual	individual	gets	individual	and so, when, uh, you or i as an individual gets on a jury *t*-1 we tend *-2 to have certain mental images of what *t*-3's what because we see the headlines, uh,	###well, one of the others things that *t*-1 gets me on, on the juries is that often in the newspaper, i, i tend *-3 to hear two things that, well, that *t*-2 go on.###one is, 0 you often see in the headlines the big numbers.###speakerb27.###uh-huh.###speakera28.###uh, and many of those get overturned *-1 or get reduced *-1 in terms of sentences, or get changed *-1 by a judge or an appeals court###speakerb29.###right.###speakera30.###and that never makes the, the press
98600:22	his attorney	attorney	gets	attorney	and, and his attorney gets his sentences, sentencing reduced *-1 because he's gone to a lesser charge, like, i don't know what, assault or something or,	###and that never makes the, the press###and so, when, uh, you or i as an individual gets on a jury *t*-1 we tend *-2 to have certain mental images of what *t*-3's what because we see the headlines, uh,###and we don't have, a-, again, a lot of knowledge,###so we don't know what *t*-1 is really going on, what *t*-2 is, uh, really the range of sentences or awards that *t*-3 are, uh, are actually, uh, in the end applied *-4.###speakerb31.###right.###speakera32.###speakerb33.###right.### well, well, also what i don't think 0 *t*-1 is fair, either, is when you have like a, say a rapist, come in *t*-2,
98628:14	this person	person	has	person	well, okay this person has been charged *-1 with first degree rape, uh,	###speakerb39.### that's, that's not right.###speakera40.###well, that's where, uh, the role of juries is, is restricted *-1 *t*-2###and, i'm not sure 0 i'd want *-1 to change that aspect of it,###one is, 0 it's restricted *-1 in the sense that, juries only decide the charges that *t*-2 are actually, uh, brought *-3, you know###speakerb41.###right.###speakera42.###if it's first degree rape, second deg-, degree rape or whatever, they only get *-1 to decide on that,
98643:4	somebody	somebody	thinks	somebody	somebody thinks 0 it, it had *?*, because they've got it there.	###uh, such like, maybe in murder they get *-1 to choose whether it's, uh, premeditated or one or two of the lesser degrees.###the other thing that juries are restricted *-1 on *t*-2 and, and at least to me this has been one of the frustrating things in my, even in my own experiences, that you usually don't get *-3 to hear all the information.###speakerb45.###yeah.###speakera46.###it's what information *t*-1 is presented *-2###and, uh, i don't know that juries have a right * to know more because in a sense we call those safeguards,###but often juries hear only a fraction of the, of the story when they have *-1 to decide guilt or innocence *t*-2.###speakerb47.###and to me, how can you, how can you make a decision if you don't have all of the evidence in front of, whether it be, whether it pertains to the case or not *t*-1,

100131:35	mental capacity	capacity	deteriorates	capacity	and then if health or, or mental capacity deteriorates, they're able *-1 to take the next steps without so much change	###usually there has *-1 to be some wealth involved *, which *t*-2 is great, if, if you're financially, if, if you don't make the decisions so late that you're worried about money###but the, the places like presbyterian village and some of the, the retirement places where, where they have different levels of care *t*-1 seems *-2 to be so much better, as far as elderly people adapting.###speakerb64.###uh-huh.###speakera65.###they're able *-1 to move in while they're still independent and still social###speakerb66.###uh-huh.###speakera67.### and, and they do group things.
100137:11	my aunt's mother	mother	is	mother	my aunt's mother is, uh, gotten ill recently	###speakerb66.###uh-huh.###speakera67.### and, and they do group things.###and then if health or, or mental capacity deteriorates, they're able *-1 to take the next steps without so much change###and oh, i wish 0 everybody could go that direction rather than *-1 just all of a sudden moving out of the home 0 they've always been in *t*-2.###it's really kind of difficult.###speakerb68.###yeah,###i have a, um,
100214:6	the child	child	is	child	the child is going, why don't you want *-1 to be close to me and your other family *t*-2.	###speakera93.###yeah.###and the quality of life really isn't there.###speakerb94.###yeah.###speakera95.###oh it's tough,###it really is *?*.###speakerb96.###that's from the child's standpoint.
100301:58	my family	family	has	family	i guess 0 that's mumblex, my, that's something that my family has always believed strongly in *t*-1,	###speakerb9.###i think 0 it's a good idea.###i think 0 everybody should, should, uh, put in their time so * to speak for the, for the good of the, the nation and for the good of themselves.###speakera10.###yeah.###speakerb11.###i think 0 it's, uh,###would every-, everyone grow up and mature and, and realize what this country's all about *t*-1.###speakera12.###i just, um,
100463:38	the world	world	is	world	gosh i'm sure, 0 not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas	###speakera72.###yeah.###and i do think, um, 0 the schools,###if you're trying *-1 to do something, even with food drives###and, uh, sometimes what richardson and plano both,###i mean when you live in areas like that where there's so much *t*-2 *t*-3 they don't realize what a small percentage of the world that is *t*-1.###speakerb73.###uh-huh.###speakera74.###i mean, that's, uh,
100487:42	their life	life	has	life	every youth that *t*-1's ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed *-2	###speakera80.###um, and it is, it's, uh,###and they've also see that there's, there's a different way of life and those families are really close.###some of the things, that we talked about *t*-1 that *t*-2 were common in the fifties are still there###speakerb81.###speakera82.###speakerb83.###uh-huh.###speakera84.###and, uh, it really,
100582:6	the home	home	is	home	the home is the key.	###but for those students who *t*-1 are determined *-2 to do well anyway, that, you know, * handling a job was very possible. you know, and that it seemed *-3 to have more 0 * to do *t*-4 with other factors.###speakerb14.###speakera15.###speakerb16.###i think so too.###speakera17.###you know like, what are their plans after high school *t*-1, you know.###and what's their home situation *t*-1.###you know that,###speakerb18.
100592:32	the main goal	goal	is	goal	and, uh, the-, the main goal is * making money now	###the home is the key.###speakera19.###right.###speakerb20.###i think really is *?* because if the home, does not place a high priority on education###speakera21.###speakerb22.###speakera23.###right.###speakerb24.
100607:40	the most important thing	thing	is	thing	but, but that the most important thing is still, you know * getting your education.	###speakera27.###sure.###speakerb28.###so, uh,###speakera29.###but there can still be an attitude of###speakerb30.###right.###speakera31.###you know, this is a stopgap measure because we need it right now,
100620:72	their mo-, biggest concern	concern	is	concern	and if, if children come to school, yes, *-1 insecure and their mo-, biggest concern is survival both at home,	###speakera33.###speakerb34.###speakera35.###well when they meant, said the, the topic, you know, of what *t*-1's wrong with the public schools *t*-2, my, my first im-, impulse was 0 it isn't really what *t*-3's wrong with the public, public schools.###it's what *t*-1's wrong with families.###speakerb36.###that's right.###speakera37.###speakerb38.###it's what *t*-1's wrong with families
100664:27	my feeling	feeling	is	feeling	but, you know, part of my feeling is that if you solve, help them to work through their problems while they're littler, then they won't have as many problems up there.	###speakera55.###well we've got, uh, you know at our school we have over a thousand elementary kids###and last year was the first year that we ever had more than one counselor *t*-1.###and that's just really not enough.###speakerb56.###no.###it isn't *?*.###speakera57.###and i was talking to somebody that *t*-1 teaches in a middle school###and they said, oh, but we need more in the middle school because that's when kids are, you know, at a tougher and rougher age and all that *t*-1.
100680:43	a counselor	counselor	stays	counselor	so they started, uh, *-1 dividing the kids up so that a counselor stays with her group of counselees through you know, through all three years of middle school.	###speakera59.###really.###speakerb60.###we have always, though, had three at middle schools because we had about a thousand kids###and they divided them up between three counselors###but for a good while every year they'd have a different counselor###and they decided 0 that didn't work.###speakera61.###yeah.###speakerb62.
100707:29	education	education	is	education	b-, because, uh, education is the key to our future	###speakerb72.###speakera73.###* to change,###yeah.###speakerb74.###and occasionally that happens.###speakera75.###right.###speakerb76.###but, it is frightening
100735:61	the public education	education	is	education	but, anyway, one of the key things was that that we believed that the public education is the best economic value.	###right.###speakerb84.###that's no good.###speakera85.###i'm on that, um, campus strategic planning committee for my school.###speakerb86.###uh-huh.###speakera87.###and, uh, one of the, uh, you know, oh,###they have all these different names for things, strategies and all these different things.
100740:47	public education	education	fails	education	anyway, you know, the point was, what *t*-1 happens when public education fails *t*-2?	###speakerb86.###uh-huh.###speakera87.###and, uh, one of the, uh, you know, oh,###they have all these different names for things, strategies and all these different things.###but, anyway, one of the key things was that that we believed that the public education is the best economic value.###then i think 0 they decided *-1 to strike economic.###speakerb88.###uh-huh.###speakera89.
100799:18	the gang violence	violence	is	violence	i think 0 the gang violence is scaring everyone to death too.	###speakera111.###right.###speakerb112.###uh-huh###speakera113.###that's so important,###speakerb114.###then that, that helps a lot.###speakera115.###speakerb116.
100929:25	preston hollow	hollow	is	hollow	and what i liked *t*-1 about preston hollow is that the people that *t*-2 were there when cheryl was two *t*-4, which *t*-3 was fifteen years ago, many of them are still there today.	###but, it was a nightmare back when cheryl was little *t*-1###and this is one of the few churches that *t*-1 did it.###there were a couple downtown dallas###but they were so, seemed, cold and impersonal,###speakerb37.###speakera38.###i just couldn't hack it.###speakerb39.###uh-huh.###speakera40.
101136:8	the bank	bank	has	bank	and the bank has a lot of programs *ich*-1 now for child care referrals.	###speakera122.###we try *-1 to work it with their hours.###and that helps because you don't have *-1 to just wean yourself cold turkey and say okay, i never get *-2 to see my baby for eight hours a day again.###speakerb123.###yeah.###speakera124.###speakerb125.###right.###right.###speakera126.

133264:22	my dad	dad	is	dad	and, and my dad is actually on the school board there,	###and it shows up.###that's one idea.###do you have any?###speakerb12.###um, i don't know,### i'm pretty, i think 0 i'm pretty satisfied with, um,### i gre-, i grew up in plano###speakera13.###uh-huh.###speakerb14.
133275:6	arlington	arlington	is	arlington	and arlington is excellent now,	###so, i kind of kept up with a lot of things that *t*-1 went on.###speakera15.###yeah,###it's###plano, uh, improved greatly in the last twenty, twenty-five years###speakerb16.###yeah.###speakera17.###that's for sure.###it used *-1 to be the pits.
133283:4	something	something	is	something	something is definitely wrong.	###that's for sure.###it used *-1 to be the pits.###and arlington is excellent now,###but i'm just speaking overall across the country.###speakerb18.###oh.###speakera19.###speakerb20.###yeah.###speakera21.
133295:6	another problem	problem	is	problem	another problem is 0 you're going *-1 to keep the smarter people in the system too long *-2 paying the wages 0 they do *t*-3.	###uh-huh.###speakera23.###and, uh, one thing, they don't spend as much time *-1 just teaching reading and writing,###so a lot of kids are just being promoted *-1 from year to year###and they truly can't read###speakerb24.###right.###speakera25.###so i don't know how they expect them to, uh, pass history *t*-2 when they can't read anything, you know, even read a word problem in math *t*-1.###so, um, that's definitely a problem.
133326:49	your teacher	teacher	is	teacher	it depends on, uh, what school you're in *t*-1 and who your teacher is *t*-2, actually	###you may have half literature for the whole year,###whereas in another one they're going *-1 to concentrate on grammar and give you a little literature,###speakerb34.###grammar.###speakera35.###it's up to the teacher, in other words.###so that's kind of o-, you know, that's kind of odd to me.###speakerb36.###yeah.###speakera37.
133331:9	arlington	arlington	is	arlington	overall, arlington is good, one of the better ones in the state,	###it's up to the teacher, in other words.###so that's kind of o-, you know, that's kind of odd to me.###speakerb36.###yeah.###speakera37.###it depends on, uh, what school you're in *t*-1 and who your teacher is *t*-2, actually###speakerb38.###uh-huh.###speakera39.###or is how you end up *t*-1.
133336:13	the thing	thing	is	thing	that's the thing is * just to look at the school system in the area that you move into *t*-1 before you.	###it depends on, uh, what school you're in *t*-1 and who your teacher is *t*-2, actually###speakerb38.###uh-huh.###speakera39.###or is how you end up *t*-1.###overall, arlington is good, one of the better ones in the state,###so i guess 0 we lucked out when we moved here *t*-1.###speakerb40.###uh-huh.###so, yeah,
133339:53	america	america	is	america	of course we have a slight problem in that, uh, the number of the illiterate in america is mushrooming at this point,	###speakera39.###or is how you end up *t*-1.###overall, arlington is good, one of the better ones in the state,###so i guess 0 we lucked out when we moved here *t*-1.###speakerb40.###uh-huh.###so, yeah,###that's the thing is * just to look at the school system in the area that you move into *t*-1 before you.###speakera41.###uh-huh.
133360:52	just plain literacy	literacy	goes	literacy	but, uh. we actually rank *-1 forty-ninth in the world as far as just plain literacy goes *?*, you know.	###and i had never even thought of it.###actually it makes sense to a certain extent,###because sometimes, like a third grade teacher will get kids from second grade that *t*-1 didn't even learn what, uh, they should *?* *t*-2 *-3 to do the work that she is supposed *-4 to teach *t*-5, you know. mumblex and according to her plan,###speakerb46.###uh-huh.###speakera47.###so i guess 0 if there was a national curriculum we'd at least have a certain amount that all kids would learn *t*-1.###speakerb48.###right.###speakera49.
133410:9	aids	aids	is	aids	well, aids is a nasty, terrible disease,	###speakerb68.###i did.###speakera69.###through high school.###speakerb70.###uh-huh,###uh, kinder-,###speakerb1.###you think about aids research?###speakera2.
133449:6	whose figure	figure	is	figure	whose figure is that *t*-1?	###uh, in the country, america.###speakerb11.###oh, really?###speakera12.###yeah###speakerb13.###um, that's,###speakera14.###and they have millions.###speakerb15.
133536:20	the immune system	system	ceases	system	is it just that the immune system ceases *-1 to function properly	###he's actually, um,###he had aids related complex for a while,###and he is now in full-blown aids, *-1 really not doing very well, and has a brain tumor or some-, that sort of thing.###speakera46.###yeah,###it sounds awful.###speakerb47.###yeah,### it's, it's a very nasty thing.###speakera48.
133541:14	the white blood cell count	count	goes	count	and the white blood cell count goes down,	###it sounds awful.###speakerb47.###yeah,### it's, it's a very nasty thing.###speakera48.###is it just that the immune system ceases *-1 to function properly###and,###speakerb49.###um, yeah,### that's, that's basically it, that, um, the immune system can at first slow down,
133565:20	the recession	recession	is	recession	uh, the short term, the recession is getting, getting top attention.	###all right,###well.###speakera2.###um, short term, i don't think 0 anything's going *-1 to be done *-2 about it or probably should be done *-1 about it.###speakerb3.###right.###speakera4.###speakerb5.###uh, are you saying 0 you don't think 0 anything should be done *-1 in the short term?###speakera6.
133569:13	the other thing	thing	is	thing	0 the other thing is *t*-1, is that we've got these, um, these, all these bank defaults going on, and, and savings and loan defaults, and, and, uh, uh,	###speakerb3.###right.###speakera4.###speakerb5.###uh, are you saying 0 you don't think 0 anything should be done *-1 in the short term?###speakera6.###uh, the short term, the recession is getting, getting top attention.###speakerb7.###yeah,### i, i think that you're absolutely right there.
133581:50	the administration	administration	is	administration	um, i'm not really, uh, sure that i even understand why the administration is proposing, for instance, tax reductions *t*-1, because it seems to me that if, if, if they're talking about * reducing, uh, the tax that *t*-4 needs *-2 to be paid *-5, or the tax that *t*-3's currently being paid *-6, then that can't, it seems to me 0 it can't possibly, you know, help with the, the deficit picture.	###and that effectively adds to whether it's officially on the books or not.###speakerb9.###right.###exactly.###um,###speakera10.###and that's got *-1 to be paid *-2.###speakerb11.###exactly,### and, and, uh, so this creates a pretty serious problem that *t*-1's going *-2 to continue *-3 to be with us for a while 0 *t*-4 to come.
133598:6	my understanding	understanding	is	understanding	my understanding is 0 what they're try-, what, what supposedly they're trying *-1 to do *t*-3 by *-4 reducing taxes is * to kind of jump start the economy, the idea being that if people have *-2 to pay less money in taxes, they'll have more money 0 * to spend *t*-5, uh,	###um, and the, the severity of the deficit picture already limits the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting 0 you can do *t*-1 without, uh, *-2 bringing on, on serious problems for the longer term.###speakerb15.###yeah,###exactly.###speakera16.###so that, that, that's the current predicament.###speakerb17.###yeah,###it see-, seems like it's, it's a kind of a catch twenty-two.###i mean, it's, it's the, um,
133607:31	the recession	recession	is	recession	it's probably a judgment of how bad the recession is *t*-1.	###i mean, it's, it's the, um,###my understanding is 0 what they're try-, what, what supposedly they're trying *-1 to do *t*-3 by *-4 reducing taxes is * to kind of jump start the economy, the idea being that if people have *-2 to pay less money in taxes, they'll have more money 0 * to spend *t*-5, uh,###and if they have more money 0 * to spend *t*-1, then that will be a spur to productivity, particularly commercial productivity, uh, which in turn *t*-2 will generate revenue.###but it, it seems like, like, uh, it's sort of a, uh, a sp-, an unending spiral,###and it, it, it, uh,### i'm, i'm not sure that there's any real genuine truth to the, uh, the idea that, that, uh, that * decreasing taxes, particularly the kinds that *t*-1 are being recommended *-2 bye-bye the bush administration and things like capital gains taxes and so forth is going *-4 to, uh, result in substantial amounts of money, you know, 0 for consumers to spend *t*-3.###and, uh,###speakera18.###yeah,###i'm not sure how i feel *t*-3 about *-2 paying on the quest, the long term quests that tax cuts are worth *t*-1 at this point.
133637:85	more defense cuts	defense	cuts	defense	um, at various places 0 * to look *t*-1 for, for * cutting the budget, first of all i consider more defense cuts than *?* are already planned *-2 depending on the world situation.	###speakerb27.###it's a sort of a piece of luck.###speakera28.###that's the upside to the recession.###speakerb29.###yeah, um.###i don't know,###what kind of things do you think 0 *t*-1 can be done *-2 in, in, uh, in the long term?###speakera30.###mumblex well, * can be done *-1 or * will be done *-2 are two different things.

145323:23	my future	future	is	future	as a matter of fact, my future is banked *-1 on that, uh, professionally because i believe that, that there are, uh, pressing needs in the marketplace, unmet * by schools, colleges universities for, uh, * learning a lot of things that kids can learn *t*-2 *-3 watching sesame street and in child care.	###speakera95.###uh-huh.###speakerb96.###speakera97.###yeah.###speakerb98.###speakera99.###yeah.###speakerb100.###because, i think 0 what we're going *-1 to go to *t*-2 is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market.

145644:52	everyone	everyone	knows	everyone	and that person can call, you know, beforehand and just make * sure 0 everyone knows, too.	###and people would come from seattle to there and, uh, * let's see, nevada and in that area, washington and nevada to southern utah###and they would, uh, assign a different person, each time 0 they had a reunion *t*-1 they'd assign a different person to be in charge of * notifying everybody.###speakerb7.###oh, okay,###that makes sense.###nobody's out of a lot of trouble more than once.###speakera8.###yeah,###yeah###and the people who *t*-1 are down there, like, they'll assign one person in the utah area, one person in the washington area

146553:13	staff	staff	makes	staff	but attitude of staff makes such a tremendous difference.	###yes.###speakera25.###speakerb26.###i do think that there are some significant kinds of things 0 * to to look for *t*-4 *ich*-1, you know, if you are faced *-2 with * placing someone. in a place like that, uh, you know, aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that *t*-3 is offered *-5 and such###speakera27.###right.###speakerb28.###speakera29.###uh-huh.###speakerb30.
146596:60	the nursing home	home	accepts	home	i think 0 it would matter too, uh, kinds of, uh, disabilities that the nursing home accepts *t*-1. because there are some, uh, who *t*-2 poor things, you know, don't have, uh, any real grasp on reality any longer.	###yeah.###speakera43.###speakerb44.###uh-huh.###speakera45.###uh, the, the attitude of the staff as you said is really very very important.###speakerb46.###uh-huh.###speakera47.###speakerb48.
146645:53	somebody	somebody	says	somebody	i think 0 if we wait *ich*-3, uh, which *t*-1 is happening until somebody says 0 we have *-2 to do it it is going *-4 to be to late.	###and they don't, don't, uh, they weren't really together with the rest of them, when they got together for such activities *t*-1.###speakerb66.###yes###and that can,###speakerb1.###okay,###so now what are your opinions on recycling *t*-1?###speakera2.###well, i definitely think that we need *-1 to start *-2 recycling.###i think 0 it has got *-1 to be an individual responsibility until,
146696:35	new york	york	is	york	an-, that's how it is *t*-1 in new york isn't it *?*.	###there is no really recycling facilities.###speakera16.###no.###we have a pilot program in arlington *ich*-1 *-2 going on i think in the north part of the city where they are have people people separate the garbage as, the trash as they put it out *t*-3.###speakerb17.###i think 0 that is a good idea.###speakera18.###and i think 0 that is what it is going *-1 to have *-2 to come to *t*-3. where we are just forced *-4 to *t*-5.###speakerb19.###besides, well like a law or whatever.
146727:9	our garage	garage	is	garage	like our garage is always full of sacks of newspapers	###but,###speakerb29.###plus you have *-1 to have a place 0 *-2 to store all of it *t*-3###speakera30.###yeah.###speakerb31.###and see i live in an apartment.###speakera32.###yeah.###it is very difficult.

147159:111	a cold spell	spell	is	spell	i think 0 something *ich*-2 too that you probably see *t*-3 in older states, all we, we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces *t*-1.	###speakera22.###it's kind of scary.###speakerb23.###well, it is scary###and i think 0 it will, uh, continue *-1 to force us to clean up our act, literally and figuratively.###speakera24.###yeah.###speakerb25.###we've got *-1 to learn *-2 to manage without *-3 destroying the environment.###speakera26.
147180:8	our economy	economy	seems	economy	and our economy seems *-1 to,	###and it's really bad in places like los angeles,###and, it's gotten bad in denver###speakera32.###right.###speakerb33.### and, and, uh, it's not too bad around here although you see it, you know, more and more in the sky.###and people in this country are really wedded *-1 to their, uh, cars,###speakera34.###right.###speakerb35.
147193:6	my husband	husband	likes	husband	my husband likes *-1 to go out and jog	###yeah.###in this area too since, you know, in texas we're so spread out,###speakerb37.###yeah.###speakera38.###we have *-1 to drive so far,###but i know 0 in colorado i have witnessed that where it just, uh, it just stacks up at the when the rockies starts *t*-1 *t*-2,###but we're even getting it here.###we can drive into, when we've been on vacation or something *t*-1 drive into fort worth or dallas###and you can tell it in the mornings too.
147240:132	the economy	economy	is	economy	and, and i'm, i'm not sure how long it's going *-4 to take *t*-5 or what it's going *-1 to take *t*-6 because they keep *-7 saying that the economy is going *-2 to depend on how many cars and, houses we sell *t*-3.	###yeah.###speakerb53.###and in this country, uh, the, the solution that, that people seem *-1 to think 0 *t*-2 work are politically unacceptable.###for example, * taxing people heavily for *-1 using their cars.###speakera54.###yeah.###speakerb55.###and, uh, i have a little sports car that i enjoy *-1 using *t*-2###and i know just like anybody else how much fun it *exp*-2 is *t*-1 * to drive###but i think, uh, 0 we're going *-1 to have *-2 to make some fundamental changes

157630:65	an acquittal	acquittal	is	acquittal	well, i'd be curious as to what the, uh, requirement for a, an acquittal is *t*-1.	###and that's why i phrased it that way *t*-1.###speakera6.###yeah.###speakerb7.###i wonder,### the difference, yeah, the difference could be that for, uh, state, if there is such a thing, state felonies versus federal felonies that federal, things that *t*-1 are under federal jurisdiction require the unanimous vote,###and things that *t*-1 are under state jurisdiction, even criminal don't require,###but i don't know what the, the laws,###do you think that that's an unreasonable, uh, requirement that they be unanimous?###speakera8.

165992:76	the taurus	taurus	is	taurus	and, and the two cars that *t*-1 apparently are close to that. that *t*-2 actually have high reliability, the taurus is one of the highest u s cars.	###uh-huh.###speakera65.###you set down.###you look at consumer reports.###we've been pouring over consumer reports###and you just get so depressed for the u s auto makers when you do that *t*-1.###speakerb66.###yeah.###speakera67.###because you see the reliability and the types of problems 0 they have *t*-1
166027:54	massachusetts	massachusetts	has	massachusetts	and, and i think that, and i know 0 massachusetts has,	###well, here they and,###uh, * live in an apartment complex.###speakera5.###uh-huh.###speakerb6.###and they only have one set of recycling bins, one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters.###so a lot of the people who *t*-1 live up front don't bother *-2 to recycle because, you know, it *exp*-3's too far * to carry the stuff to the other bins.###speakera7.### i, i know 0 a lot, i think 0 a lot of, uh, the, the issues with regard to recycling are that, uh, people have *-1 to be motivated *-2 to do, to do something like that because it does take extra effort.###whether
166090:40	the past	past	has	past	well, part of the problem with * recycling them in the past has been 0 the covers are made *-1 with a clay based paper.	###speakera19.###yeah.### they, they just,###matter of fact, that, that reminded me of an article 0 i saw *t*-1 in the pa-,###the local schools, you could send your phone book to your, uh, to, with your kid to school###and what they'll do *t*-1 is they'll recycle it.###because there was an article or a story done * awhile ago that, uh, trash, uh, the telephone books are the type of thing that *t*-1 don't break down over a long period of time.###a guy went to a d-, a landfill, dug down five feet and, and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty###because they don't, they don't degrade over such a period of time.###speakerb20.
166118:65	a lot	lot	has	lot	uh, although i'm not a mother, i, i still think that, uh, a lot has changed since ten years ago.	###well, i would say 0 as, far as social changes go *?*, uh, i think 0 *t*-1 families were more together.### they, they did more things together.###speakera3.###uh-huh.###speakerb4.###uh, they ate dinner at the table together.###uh, the parents usually took out time, uh, you know, more time than they do now *-1 to come with the children and just spend the day *-2 doing a family activity.###speakera5.###uh-huh.###speakerb6.
166124:26	today	today	seems	today	well, uh, actually ten years from today seems rather short.	###uh, the parents usually took out time, uh, you know, more time than they do now *-1 to come with the children and just spend the day *-2 doing a family activity.###speakera5.###uh-huh.###speakerb6.###uh, although i'm not a mother, i, i still think that, uh, a lot has changed since ten years ago.###uh, what do you think *t*-1 about that?###speakera7.###we,###speakerb8.###speakera9.
166139:18	the individual	individual	has	individual	do you think that the individual has as much time as they did, * let's say, ten, twenty years ago?	###speakerb12.###uh-huh.###speakera13.###and, uh, i don't know,###it leaves, leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that.###in other words, they just prioritize their lives differently.###but i think 0 that has a lot 0 * to do *t*-1 with economic situation.###speakerb14.###yes.###what about like as far as, uh, social changes in the individual?
166306:90	the dropout rate	rate	is	rate	but then, again, i'm not quite sure where the blame ought *-1 to be put *-1 *t*-2. uh, because the, the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-,	###i mean, somebody's getting, getting a good education because we, continue *-1 to employ people.###speakerb14.###right.###speakera15.###speakerb16.###speakera17.###but, uh, i don't, i don't understand the, uh, i don't understand, i guess 0 *t*-1, why the schools don-, seem *-2 to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities *t*-3.###speakerb18.###uh, well, i don't pretend *-1 to understand that either.###uh, but i'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that *t*-1 ought *-2 to be blamed *-3 on the schools.
166347:14	that family	family	is	family	i mean that family is making over a hundred grand.	###speakera25.###speakerb26.###uh-huh.###speakera27.###they both work all summer full-time.###and from their teaching job alone, they pull in forty grand each.###speakerb28.###yeah.###well, it, it,###speakera29.
166439:13	steve largent	largent	is	largent	now that steve largent is gone, i kind of lose a little bit for them	###speakerb22.### they're not, they're not my favorite totally.###but i do like them.###i like,###yeah.###speakera23.###yo-,###speakerb24.###seahawks are good.###they,

166505:70	too much running	running	gets	running	i, * to be honest with you, i find th-, that too much running gets pretty boring as well	###speakerb46.###yeah.### that, that, that's boring for me.### i, i'll take the passing teams any day.###speakera47.###yeah.###speakerb48.###but,###speakera49.###well, i can see, i can see definitely how you get into that *t*-1.
166526:6	even college	college	is	college	even college is all can we get on t v	###sure.###speakerb54.### and but,###speakera55.###well, i think 0 they're starting *-1 to realize that.###a lot of the, like the big eight teams that *t*-1 used *-2 to run so much. i think 0 they're starting *-3 to realize that they just can't compete anymore.###speakerb56.###yeah.###it's high dollar.###you know, it's all, it's all money now.
166537:8	this world league	league	is	league	this world league is coming in?	###speakera57.###right.###speakerb58.###so.###speakera59.###yeah.###speakerb60.### that's, that's,###speakera61.###so, uh, what's d-,

166625:4	rugby	rugby	is	rugby	rugby is definitely big in college because it's something 0 a bunch of fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do *t*-1.	###yeah, mumblex.###yeah,### there's an element there's definitely an element of stupidity in there somewhere.###speakerb86.###yeah.###that's just wild.###that's why it's a go-, a big college thing *t*-1.###speakera87.###yeah###speakerb88.
166731:77	an invasion	invasion	is	invasion	well, uh, one of the things that, uh, that i found *t*-1 to be, uh, an invasion is when i pay for something with a credit card *t*-2 and they ask me *-3 to put my telephone number on the, on the, uh, credit card bill *t*-2.	###i'm from,###i root for nebraska###so i'm, i don't have a real love for miami anyway.###speakerb126.###speakera127.###but, i don't know,### i, i guess, 0 i get, into pretty much,###speakera1.###so, do you, your privacy being invaded *-1 at any time?###speakerb2.
166776:90	someone	someone	asks	someone	and i think that, it, it *exp*-1's one thing f-, * to, uh, voluntarily give it because someone asks.	###speakera13.###that really burns me because, hey, you're required *-1.###you have *-1 to do that.###speakerb14.###right.###speakera15.###and nowhere does it say 0 you h-, asks you whether you have permission *ich*-1 or not * to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone.###speakerb16.###uh-huh.###speakera17.
166795:26	revenue	revenue	is	revenue	* en-, enhancing revenue is the, uh, phrase 0 they use *t*-1.	###speakerb20.###i agree with you there.###speakera21.###speakerb22.###that's something that, uh, people have seen *t*-1.###oh, here's *t*-2 an easy way 0 * to make some money *t*-1.###but, uh, i don't know if that's been challenged *-1 in the courts or not.### i, i've heard, fairly recently, uh, some talk about that in this, in, in my state.###uh, the budget problems up here are, are pretty tense.###and people are looking for alternate ways of, uh,
166860:43	the college	college	knows	college	i mean, it *exp*-1's one thing that i, and the college knows that	### and, and they say, oh, we, we know you.###you, uh, had, uh, contributed x amount last year.###can you do better this year?###and, you know, like * hold on here.###speakerb44.###how do you know that *t*-1?###speakera45.### who, how do you know that *t*-1?### why, why you even telling me this *t*-1?###is it any of your business?
166885:6	my grandfather	grandfather	is	grandfather	my grandfather is ninety-two years old.	###uh-huh.###speakerb52.###speakera53.###right.###speakerb54.###speakera1.###speakerb2.###well, julie, uh, are you in a situation where you'd soon need *-1 to deal with, uh, special care for elderly *t*-2?###speakera3.###well, i don't know.
166921:97	my life	life	is	life	and and, for, for, i'm sure, a lot of people going into a nursing home it's like * saying my life is over	###speakera13.###but, uh, my great-grandfather was put *-1 in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three *t*-2.###speakerb14.###uh-huh.###speakera15.###and, uh, * died six weeks after they put him in the home.###speakerb16.###yeah.###and i'm sure 0 that kind of thing would influence your f-, grandfather's feelings.###because, uh, i th-, you know, i think 0 for a lot of people it really is the decision of, do they still have some of their life left.
166971:48	jury selection	selection	is	selection	actually, * to tell you the truth, i think, uh, 0 jury selection is a, uh, prime, uh, discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on, uh, uh, finding of, uh, guilt.	### i th-, and i think 0 it happens more in areas where it's, uh, i guess, uh, a broad social medical system where, uh, you know, there's government medical care and that kind of thing *t*-1 *t*-2.###if it's the lot where it's funded *-1 by the individuals *t*-2### and, and i guess 0 that's sort of my lack of understanding.###i think that a majority of the places in the u s, uh, you know, there is some government aid available,###but the majority of it is to the availability of the individual * to pay.###speakera29.###uh-huh.###speakerb30.###and, uh, if you're not able *-2 to look after yourself, then you have *-1 to rely,###speakera1.
167002:63	everyone	everyone	gets	everyone	but, typically, you know, basic-, uh, typically, uh, everyone gets involved *-1 in, uh, the jury process	###um. yeah,###it seems to me 0 i'm always challenged *-2 peremptorily also when i go to these things *t*-1.###i think 0 i have a severe demeanor or something.###speakerb10.###um.###speakera11.###uh,###speakerb12.###that, uh,###speakera13.
167026:21	the defense	defense	is	defense	so, that's why the defense is there *-1 picking through them *t*-4, whereas at the same time, the, uh, the prosecutor sitting there *-3 picking through them because he wants somebody who *t*-2 will give him, uh, a guilty verdict if the facts warrant.	###so if you're a nincompoop on trial, you'd, you'd have *-1 to have nincompoops 0 *t*-2 to, uh,###speakerb20.###speakera21.###speakerb22.### you want you want a nincompoop jury because they'll sympathize with you a bit as well as *-2 hopefully being honest people and do their best *-2 to comply with the facts as they were presented *-1 to them.###speakera23.###speakerb24.###speakera25.###um.###speakerb26.
167030:29	the jury selection process	process	is	process	so, uh, i think 0 the jury selection process is pretty neat,	### you want you want a nincompoop jury because they'll sympathize with you a bit as well as *-2 hopefully being honest people and do their best *-2 to comply with the facts as they were presented *-1 to them.###speakera23.###speakerb24.###speakera25.###um.###speakerb26.###so, that's why the defense is there *-1 picking through them *t*-4, whereas at the same time, the, uh, the prosecutor sitting there *-3 picking through them because he wants somebody who *t*-2 will give him, uh, a guilty verdict if the facts warrant.###speakera27.###uh-huh.###speakerb28.
167047:50	the system	system	is	system	maybe just the judge because they're the people who *t*-1 know what the system is *t*-2 and what it's all about *t*-3 and believe in the system.	###speakera31.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakerb32.###and many times i've seen on trials 0 they have *t*-1 on t v,###the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever,###but i think that it *exp*-2 should be up to the judge and the, uh, lawyers * to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be *t*-1.###speakera33.###um.###speakerb34.
167066:28	the judicial process	process	has	process	well, preceding criminal record, according to the judicial process has nothing 0 * to do *t*-1 with the current crime.	###speakerb40.###uh, and i think 0 that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure. as opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure. also, may be a more consistent sentencing procedure.###speakera41.###well, i suppose 0 you may be right on that.###speakerb42.###speakera43.###matter of fact, i've heard that, i've heard that some of the information *ich*-2, uh, is prevented *-1 from *-1 reaching the jury, like, uh, mitigating circumstances or, or preceding, uh, criminal record or things of this nature that,###speakerb44.###speakera45.###speakerb46.
167154:39	policy	policy	is	policy	well, i think that if, if policy is established *-1 *rnr*-3 and if a mechanism is put *-2 into place *rnr*-3 * to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion, then i don't argue with it.	###speakera8.### i, i'll agree 0 it, it's not your responsibility### but, b-, is it *exp*-1 also legal, for you to do that?###speakerb9.###speakera10.### w-, w-, fr-, from what i understand *t*-3 from v-, v-, various net readings, i-, i-, it, the federal government is going *-1 to try *-2 to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes, uh, in, into place in the next few years.### it is, it is a lost revenue stream right now###and states c-, can use all the revenue 0 they can get *t*-1.### with some, with something like that, d-, do your arguments still apply?###speakerb11.
167154:62	a mechanism	mechanism	is	mechanism	well, i think that if, if policy is established *-1 *rnr*-3 and if a mechanism is put *-2 into place *rnr*-3 * to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion, then i don't argue with it.	###speakera8.### i, i'll agree 0 it, it's not your responsibility### but, b-, is it *exp*-1 also legal, for you to do that?###speakerb9.###speakera10.### w-, w-, fr-, from what i understand *t*-3 from v-, v-, various net readings, i-, i-, it, the federal government is going *-1 to try *-2 to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes, uh, in, into place in the next few years.### it is, it is a lost revenue stream right now###and states c-, can use all the revenue 0 they can get *t*-1.### with some, with something like that, d-, do your arguments still apply?###speakerb11.
167161:13	the point	point	is	point	but 0 the point is *t*-1 is that businesses do that.	###and states c-, can use all the revenue 0 they can get *t*-1.### with some, with something like that, d-, do your arguments still apply?###speakerb11.###well, i think that if, if policy is established *-1 *rnr*-3 and if a mechanism is put *-2 into place *rnr*-3 * to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion, then i don't argue with it.###because it *exp*-1's not a burden on the consumer * to remember that oh, i bought this out of state.###i need *-1 to xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to pennsylvania.###speakera12.###which *t*-1 is exactly what businesses do *t*-2 at the present.###speakerb13.###right.
167196:12	my only experience	experience	has	experience	so, my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer.	### if, if i'm a computer consulting firm and i see these, this great deal on forty-six mother boards, uh, from, from say utah. um, i, i might buy the mother boards from utah but then still have *-1 to pay pennsylvania sales tax.###my a-, accounting department will at the end of the month.### i think that i-, i-, i think 0 that's the way 0 things work in pennsylvania *t*-1.###and i know 0 they work that way in, uh, say here in d c.###speakerb25.###yeah.###see i'm unfamiliar with that because i don't, i never see that end of the business.###speakera26.###yeah.###speakerb27.
167197:36	the business	business	is	business	uh, but, if that's the case, if the business is responsible for *-3 policing themselves, then i think 0 some well defined mechanisms need *-1 to be in place so that, uh, the opportunity f-, * to forget that you owe sales tax for something, uh, can be avoided *-2.	###my a-, accounting department will at the end of the month.### i think that i-, i-, i think 0 that's the way 0 things work in pennsylvania *t*-1.###and i know 0 they work that way in, uh, say here in d c.###speakerb25.###yeah.###see i'm unfamiliar with that because i don't, i never see that end of the business.###speakera26.###yeah.###speakerb27.###so, my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer.
167200:55	a big hole	hole	does	hole	i-, i-, a r-, a big hole does exist right now, uh, in that consumers can just say oh, i, i forgot that.	###speakerb25.###yeah.###see i'm unfamiliar with that because i don't, i never see that end of the business.###speakera26.###yeah.###speakerb27.###so, my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer.###uh, but, if that's the case, if the business is responsible for *-3 policing themselves, then i think 0 some well defined mechanisms need *-1 to be in place so that, uh, the opportunity f-, * to forget that you owe sales tax for something, uh, can be avoided *-2.###speakera28.###that's true.

169043:24	military service	service	falls	service	of course, uh, uh, military service falls under the category, uh, of a public service.	###and, of course, pe-, the peace corps, the boy scouts is a, o-, is a voluntary activity.###speakerb13.###right.###speakera14.###uh,###speakerb15.### i, i think 0 that might be talking, referring to, uh, something, kind of, uh, alternative to the draft, you know.###either you have, uh, military service or some sort of alternative, nonmilitary service for a few years.###speakera16.###right,
169048:91	the charge	charge	is	charge	and, so, uh, one of the things that *t*-1 would fulfill the, at least the nominal, uh, qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft.	###speakerb15.### i, i think 0 that might be talking, referring to, uh, something, kind of, uh, alternative to the draft, you know.###either you have, uh, military service or some sort of alternative, nonmilitary service for a few years.###speakera16.###right,###of course, uh, uh, military service falls under the category, uh, of a public service.###speakerb17.###right,###right.###speakera18.

169133:14	minneapolis	minneapolis	is	minneapolis	well, um, minneapolis isn't too bad.	###and, well, it's, it, it seems pretty aggre-, aggressive oriented,###i mean, you, you look at the last mis-, military action which *t*-1 was in the persian gulf and wasn't anywhere near the united states###and it was, uh, you know, it was definitely a projection of u s power on the other side of the globe,###so, at, at any rate, this is getting off the topic###but i-,### my, my point was that there is, for people who *t*-1 don't want *-2 to do the military service, there, it would be neat if there were an alternative that *t*-4 could instill the same sort of personal discipline and sense of purpose and, uh, sense of community that the boy scouts,###speakera1.###so, um, how do you feel about the crime in your city *t*-1?###is it, uh,###speakerb2.
169148:30	crime	crime	is	crime	and in orlando, there's, crime is getting *-1 to be a bigger problem than ever,	###uh, that *ich*-1's kind of gone up in scale and, and some other things.###uh, i personally had a little experience the other day.###uh, somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck.###speakera5.###oh, really.###speakerb6.###but, actually, you know, when you look at, at minneapolis as compared to where i used *-1 to live *t*-2 *t*-3, it's really quite a bit better. uh, because i came from florida###speakera7.###uh-huh.###speakerb8.
169210:32	the new thing	thing	is	thing	it's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because everybody went to work *t*-1, you know,	###uh, but in orlando, before i moved up, we had a real problem with it.###uh, we've been broken into *-1 in my apartment about four times in like two and a half weeks.###speakera27.###oh, no.###speakerb28.###and one of the things that i, i helped *-2 organize *t*-1 was a neighborhood watch type situation down there.###speakera29.###uh-huh.###speakerb30.###uh, because they were just,

169226:42	most people's free time	time	is	time	i think 0 it's like fifty percent of most people's free time is, uh, spent *t*-1 * doing yard work outdoors.	###i think 0 given that people are pretty conscientious about it, that's a good way 0 * to, to work it *t*-1, with a neighborhood watch.###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###speakera35.###well, you know, uh, also i've heard that, uh, the newest thing is 0 a lot of people are specializing in *-1 robbing people during the time 0 they're home *t*-2. like on the weekends.###speakerb36.###oh, is that right?###speakera37.###a high percentage of, uh, free time,

169451:20	the same thing	thing	is	thing	and i think 0 the same thing is true with news.	###and the view that i would rather take *t*-1 is that there's a different amount of information 0 you need *t*-2 when you're particularly interested in a topic or, uh, particularly interested in *-7 buying something as a, you know as a hobbyist *t*-5 versus when you want *-3 to go out and buy a blender because you need *-4 to mix things *t*-6.###speakera23.###uh-huh.###speakerb24.###speakera25.###right.###speakerb26.###speakera27.###yeah.###speakerb28.

171368:21	the sentencing	sentencing	is	sentencing	th-, the sentencing is really light compared to what i think 0 they should be *t*-1 in a lot of cases you know,	###speakera17.###i think 0 maybe th-, a judge is a better judge of that###or, uh,###speakerb18.###well, s-, sometimes the sentencing is still, is not fair.###i mean even if, well the jury, i guess 0 they do decide that### but, but, i'm like you,###in a case like that, most of the time its,###i don't know,###maybe i'm too, too, uh, uh, conservative when it comes to that *t*-1.
171379:74	prison	prison	is	prison	but people who *t*-4 d-, don't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like *t*-1 and what the options are *t*-2, * to ask them *-3 to decide for one case, on one person, based on what they see *t*-5, i think 0 that is maybe, uh, a little bit naive.	###uh,###speakera19.###yeah.###speakerb20.###speakera21.###well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom, i trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent.###that's usually a matter of who * to believe *t*-2 and what facts * to believe *t*-1.###speakerb22.###right.###speakera23.
171392:137	the judge	judge	gets	judge	but i guess, i guess 0 i like the system that they have *t*-1 in some places where the defendant gets *-3 to choose whether he's, goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets *t*-2 to choose it *t*-4.	###speakera25.###in texas here, people tend *-1 to get whipped *-2 up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people.###speakerb26.###uh-huh.###speakera27.###uh, it's kind of, uh, uh, a hanging jury atmosphere.###speakerb28.###right.###speakera29.###but in a lot of places, i think 0 people bend over the other way,
171406:10	the thing	thing	is	thing	but, the thing is too, 0 maybe they need more of a, i don't know, more of a expert types to, to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick, you know, joe blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever an-, and call them in.	###speakera31.###i kind of like that system.###yeah.###speakerb32.###yeah.### that's, that's not a bad system.###but i, i do think 0 it needs *-1 to be shaken *-2 up a little bit.###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.

172202:79	the jury	jury	is	jury	well, uh, in the case of, civil, uh, things, i think maybe the, the use of the jury is very, often to the lawyer's advantage	###and i suspect it, in cases like,###i guess 0 we were supposed *-1 to be doing criminals *ich*-2 though, rather than civil.###is that right?###speakera49.###well, i, i, i-, we're at liberty *-1 to, to talk and, and meander as long as it's all on the same theme.###speakerb50.###yeah.###speakera51.###uh-huh.###speakerb52.
